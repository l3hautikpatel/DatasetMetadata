# DataSet`s MetaData for machine learning 

## Abstract
This project aims to streamline how researchers and data scientists discover and access scientific datasets by creating an integrated platform that consolidates metadata from multiple sources, such as Kaggle, UCI, and other scientific dataset repositories. Our platform addresses the inefficiencies in current research workflows through standardized metadata, advanced preprocessing, and visualization tools, ultimately reducing the time spent on data discovery.

## Introduction
This project develops a **Metadata Management System** (MMS) designed to make it easier for researchers and data scientists to discover and access datasets for their work. The MMS consolidates metadata from multiple repositories, ensures consistent and high-quality metadata, and presents an easy-to-use interface for dataset comparison, search, and exploration.

## Project Purpose
The main goal of this project is to reduce inefficiencies in the research workflow by addressing the fragmentation and inconsistencies in metadata across different dataset repositories. Our system will allow users to search, compare, and access datasets efficiently through a unified platform.

## Key Features
- **Unified Search:** Search across multiple repositories (e.g., Kaggle, UCI) with advanced filtering options.
- **Dataset Comparison:** Tools for comparing datasets and their characteristics to make informed decisions.
- **Visualization Tools:** Integration with PowerBI for visualizations of dataset metadata and characteristics.
- **API Access:** RESTful APIs for programmatic integration and automated interactions with the system.
- **User Management:** Registration, authentication, and profile management for personalized user experiences.
- **Version Control:** Track updates to dataset metadata with versioning to maintain accurate and up-to-date records.

## System Architecture
The **Metadata Management System** is built with a layered architecture:
1. **Data Collection Layer:** Integrates APIs from Kaggle and web scraping from UCI Repository, with future extensibility for adding more sources.
2. **Data Processing Layer:** Handles metadata extraction, validation, and schema mapping to ensure consistency.
3. **Storage Layer:** Utilizes a NoSQL database for flexible schema management and version control of metadata.
4. **Application Layer:** Provides RESTful APIs for data interaction and user management.
5. **Presentation Layer:** Features a responsive web interface with integrated PowerBI visualizations for user-friendly exploration of datasets.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Django
- PowerBI
- NoSQL database (e.g., MongoDB)

### Steps to Install:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone E:\Coding\ADT MetaData\Picture1.png
   cd metadata-management-system
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up the database (MongoDB):
   Follow the database setup instructions in the database configuration section.

4. Run the Django server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

Your system should now be running locally.

## Usage

Once the system is up and running, you can access the platform via your browser at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`. Here are some things you can do:

- **Search Datasets:** Use the search bar to find datasets from Kaggle and UCI.
- **Compare Datasets:** Use the comparison tool to select and compare multiple datasets side by side.
- **Visualizations:** View dataset characteristics through integrated PowerBI visualizations.
- **Register/Login:** Create an account to save your search history and preferences.
