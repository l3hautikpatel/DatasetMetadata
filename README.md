# DataSet`s MetaData for machine learning 

## Abstract
This project aims to streamline how researchers and data scientists discover and access scientific datasets by creating an integrated platform that consolidates metadata from multiple sources, such as Kaggle, UCI, and other scientific dataset repositories. Our platform addresses the inefficiencies in current research workflows through standardized metadata, advanced preprocessing, and visualization tools, ultimately reducing the time spent on data discovery.


## Introduction
This project develops a **MetaPool** designed to make it easier for researchers and data scientists to discover and access datasets for their work. The MMS consolidates metadata from multiple repositories, ensures consistent and high-quality metadata, and presents an easy-to-use interface for dataset comparison, search, and exploration.

## Project Purpose
The main goal of this project is to reduce inefficiencies in the research workflow by addressing the fragmentation and inconsistencies in metadata across different dataset repositories. Our system will allow users to search, compare, and access datasets efficiently through a unified platform.

## Key Features
- **Unified Search:** Search across multiple repositories (e.g., Kaggle, UCI) with advanced filtering options.
- **Dataset Comparison:** Tools for comparing datasets and their characteristics to make informed decisions.
- **Visualization Tools:** Integration with PowerBI for visualizations of dataset metadata and characteristics.
- **API Access:** RESTful APIs for programmatic integration and automated interactions with the system.
- **User Management:** Registration, authentication, and profile management for personalized user experiences.
- **Version Control:** Track updates to dataset metadata with versioning to maintain accurate and up-to-date records.
