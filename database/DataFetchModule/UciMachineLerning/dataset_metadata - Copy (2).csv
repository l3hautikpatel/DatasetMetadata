These datasets can be viewed as classification or regression tasks.  The classes are ordered and not balanced (e.g. there are many more normal wines than excellent or poor ones).

The data attributes include student grades, demographic, social and school related features) and it was collected by using school reports and questionnaires. Two datasets are provided regarding the performance in two distinct subjects: Mathematics (mat) and Portuguese language (por). In [Cortez and Silva, 2008], the two datasets were modeled under binary/five-level classification and regression tasks. Important note: the target attribute G3 has a strong correlation with attributes G2 and G1. This occurs because G3 is the final year grade (issued at the 3rd period), while G1 and G2 correspond to the 1st and 2nd period grades. It is more difficult to predict G3 without G2 and G1, but such prediction is much more useful (see paper source for more details).",No,"Using data mining to predict secondary school student performance

The Car Evaluation Database contains examples with the structural information removed, i.e., directly relates CAR to the six input attributes: buying, maint, doors, persons, lug_boot, safety.

The second rating corresponds to the degree to which the auto is more risky than its price indicates. Cars are initially assigned a risk factor symbol associated with its price.   Then, if it is more risky (or less), this symbol is adjusted by moving it up (or down) the scale.  Actuarians call this process ""symboling"".  A value of +3 indicates that the auto is risky, -3 that it is probably pretty safe.

The third factor is the relative average loss payment per insured vehicle year.  This value is normalized for all autos within a particular size classification (two-door small, station wagons, sports/speciality, etc...), and represents the average loss per car per year.

Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

Check the README.txt file for further details about this dataset.

With the real probability of default as the response variable (Y), and the predictive probability of default as the independent variable (X), the simple linear regression result (Y = A + BX) shows that the forecasting model produced by artificial neural network has the highest coefficient of determination; its regression intercept (A) is close to zero, and regression coefficient (B) to one.

The classification task for this dataset is to determine whether a given email is spam or not.
 
Our collection of spam e-mails came from our postmaster and individuals who had filed spam.  Our collection of non-spam e-mails came from filed work and personal e-mails, and hence the word 'george' and the area code '650' are indicators of non-spam.  These are useful when constructing a personalized spam filter.  One would either have to blind such non-spam indicators or get a very wide collection of non-spam to generate a general purpose spam filter.

For background on spam: Cranor, Lorrie F., LaMacchia, Brian A.  Spam!, Communications of the ACM, 41(8):74-83, 1998.

Typical performance is around ~7% misclassification error. False positives (marking good mail as spam) are very undesirable.If we insist on zero false positives in the training/testing set, 20-25% of the spam passed through the filter.

Cherenkov gamma telescope observes high energy gamma rays, taking advantage of the radiation emitted by charged particles produced inside the electromagnetic showers initiated by the gammas, and developing in the atmosphere. This Cherenkov radiation (of visible to UV wavelengths) leaks through the atmosphere and gets recorded in the detector, allowing reconstruction of the shower parameters. The available information consists of pulses left by the incoming Cherenkov photons on the photomultiplier tubes, arranged in a plane, the camera. Depending on the energy of the primary gamma, a total of few hundreds to some 10000 Cherenkov photons get collected, in patterns (called the shower image), allowing to discriminate statistically those caused by primary gammas (signal) from the images of hadronic showers initiated by cosmic rays in the upper atmosphere (background).

Typically, the image of a shower after some pre-processing is an elongated cluster. Its long axis is oriented towards the camera center if the shower axis is parallel to the telescope's optical axis, i.e. if the telescope axis is directed towards a point source. A principal component analysis is performed in the camera plane, which results in a correlation axis and defines an ellipse. If the depositions were distributed as a bivariate Gaussian, this would be an equidensity ellipse. The characteristic parameters of this ellipse (often called Hillas parameters) are among the image parameters that can be used for discrimination. The energy depositions are typically asymmetric along the major axis, and this asymmetry can also be used in discrimination. There are, in addition, further discriminating characteristics, like the extent of the cluster in the image plane, or the total sum of depositions.

The data set was generated by a Monte Carlo program, Corsika, described in:
    D. Heck et al., CORSIKA, A Monte Carlo code to simulate extensive air showers,
    Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe FZKA 6019 (1998).

-> A collection of 425 SMS spam messages was manually extracted from the Grumbletext Web site. This is a UK forum in which cell phone users make public claims about SMS spam messages, most of them without reporting the very spam message received. The identification of the text of spam messages in the claims is a very hard and time-consuming task, and it involved carefully scanning hundreds of web pages. The Grumbletext Web site is: http://www.grumbletext.co.uk/.
-> A subset of 3,375 SMS randomly chosen ham messages of the NUS SMS Corpus (NSC), which is a dataset of about 10,000 legitimate messages collected for research at the Department of Computer Science at the National University of Singapore. The messages largely originate from Singaporeans and mostly from students attending the University. These messages were collected from volunteers who were made aware that their contributions were going to be made publicly available. The NUS SMS Corpus is avalaible at: http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~rpnlpir/downloads/corpora/smsCorpus/.
-> A list of 450 SMS ham messages collected from Caroline Tag's PhD Thesis available at http://etheses.bham.ac.uk/253/1/Tagg09PhD.pdf.

The 'Revenue' attribute can be used as the class label.

""Administrative"", ""Administrative Duration"", ""Informational"", ""Informational Duration"", ""Product Related"" and ""Product Related Duration"" represent the number of different types of pages visited by the visitor in that session and total time spent in each of these page categories. The values of these features are derived from the URL information of the pages visited by the user and updated in real time when a user takes an action, e.g. moving from one page to another. The ""Bounce Rate"", ""Exit Rate"" and ""Page Value"" features represent the metrics measured by ""Google Analytics"" for each page in the e-commerce site. The value of ""Bounce Rate"" feature for a web page refers to the percentage of visitors who enter the site from that page and then leave (""bounce"") without triggering any other requests to the analytics server during that session. The value of ""Exit Rate"" feature for a specific web page is calculated as for all pageviews to the page, the percentage that were the last in the session. The ""Page Value"" feature represents the average value for a web page that a user visited before completing an e-commerce transaction. The ""Special Day"" feature indicates the closeness of the site visiting time to a specific special day (e.g. Motherâs Day, Valentine's Day) in which the sessions are more likely to be finalized with transaction. The value of this attribute is determined by considering the dynamics of e-commerce such as the duration between the order date and delivery date. For example, for Valentinaâs day, this value takes a nonzero value between February 2 and February 12, zero before and after this date unless it is close to another special day, and its maximum value of 1 on February 8. The dataset also includes operating system, browser, region, traffic type, visitor type as returning or new visitor, a Boolean value indicating whether the date of the visit is weekend, and month of the year.",,,,,,1 citations,74950 views

   post-processed with the inverse of the ln(x+1) transform. Four different input setups were
   used. The experiments were conducted using a 10-fold (cross-validation) x 30 runs. Two
   regression metrics were measured: MAD and RMSE. A Gaussian support vector machine (SVM) fed
   with only 4 direct weather conditions (temp, RH, wind and rain) obtained the best MAD value:
   12.71 +- 0.01 (mean and confidence interval within 95% using a t-student distribution). The
   best RMSE was attained by the naive mean predictor. An analysis to the regression error curve
   (REC) shows that the SVM model predicts more examples within a lower admitted error. In effect,

Each row concerns hospital records of patients diagnosed with diabetes, who underwent laboratory, medications, and stayed up to 14 days. The goal is to determine the early readmission of the patient within 30 days of discharge. The problem is important for the following reasons. Despite high-quality evidence showing improved clinical outcomes for diabetic patients who receive various preventive and therapeutic interventions, many patients do not receive them. This can be partially attributed to arbitrary diabetes management in hospital environments, which fail to attend to glycemic control. Failure to provide proper diabetes care not only increases the managing costs for the hospitals (as the patients are readmitted) but also impacts the morbidity and mortality of the patients, who may face complications associated with diabetes.",Multivariate,Health and Medicine,"Classification, Clustering","Categorical, Integer",101766,47,The instances represent hospitalized patient records diagnosed with diabetes.,"No recommendation.

From a total of 43 people, 30 contributed to the training set and different 13 to the test set. 32x32 bitmaps are divided into nonoverlapping blocks of 4x4 and the number of on pixels are counted in each block. This generates an input matrix of 8x8 where each element is an integer in the range 0..16. This reduces dimensionality and gives invariance to small distortions.

'machine failure' label that indicates, whether the machine has failed in this particular datapoint for any of the following failure modes are true.

The machine failure consists of five independent failure modes
tool wear failure (TWF): the tool will be replaced of fail at a randomly selected tool wear time between 200 Ã¢â¬â 240 mins (120 times in our dataset). At this point in time, the tool is replaced 69 times, and fails 51 times (randomly assigned).
heat dissipation failure (HDF): heat dissipation causes a process failure, if the difference between air- and process temperature is below 8.6 K and the toolÃ¢â¬â¢s rotational speed is below 1380 rpm. This is the case for 115 data points.
power failure (PWF): the product of torque and rotational speed (in rad/s) equals the power required for the process. If this power is below 3500 W or above 9000 W, the process fails, which is the case 95 times in our dataset.
overstrain failure (OSF): if the product of tool wear and torque exceeds 11,000 minNm for the L product variant (12,000 M, 13,000 H), the process fails due to overstrain. This is true for 98 datapoints.
random failures (RNF): each process has a chance of 0,1 % to fail regardless of its process parameters. This is the case for only 5 datapoints, less than could be expected for 10,000 datapoints in our dataset.

If at least one of the above failure modes is true, the process fails and the 'machine failure' label is set to 1. It is therefore not transparent to the machine learning method, which of the failure modes has caused the process to fail ",,,,,10.24432/C5HS5C,1 citations,44387 views

The house temperature and humidity conditions were monitored with a ZigBee wireless sensor network. Each wireless node transmitted the temperature and humidity conditions around 3.3 min. Then, the wireless data was averaged for 10 minutes periods. The energy data was logged every 10 minutes with m-bus energy meters. Weather from the nearest airport weather station (Chievres Airport, Belgium) was downloaded from a public data set from Reliable Prognosis (rp5.ru), and merged together with the experimental data sets using the date and time column. Two random variables have been included in the data set for testing the regression models and to filter out non predictive attributes (parameters).

In fact this challenge faces any researcher in the field. However, although plenty of articles about predicting phishing websites have been disseminated these days, no reliable training dataset has been published publically, may be because there is no agreement in literature on the definitive features that characterize phishing webpages, hence it is difficult to shape a dataset that covers all possible features. 
In this dataset, we shed light on the important features that have proved to be sound and effective in predicting phishing websites. In addition, we propose some new features.",No,"An assessment of features related to phishing websites using an automated technique

The actual forest cover type for a given observation (30 x 30 meter cell) was determined from US Forest Service (USFS) Region 2 Resource Information System (RIS) data.  Independent variables were derived from data originally obtained from US Geological Survey (USGS) and USFS data.  Data is in raw form (not scaled) and contains binary (0 or 1) columns of data for qualitative independent variables (wilderness areas and soil types).

This study area includes four wilderness areas located in the Roosevelt National Forest of northern Colorado.  These areas represent forests with minimal human-caused disturbances, so that existing forest cover types are more a result of ecological processes rather than forest management practices.

Some background information for these four wilderness areas: Neota (area 2) probably has the highest mean elevational value of the 4 wilderness areas. Rawah (area 1) and Comanche Peak (area 3) would have a lower mean elevational value, while Cache la Poudre (area 4) would have the lowest mean elevational value. 

As for primary major tree species in these areas, Neota would have spruce/fir (type 1), while Rawah and Comanche Peak would probably have lodgepole pine (type 2) as their primary species, followed by spruce/fir and aspen (type 5). Cache la Poudre would tend to have Ponderosa pine (type 3), Douglas-fir (type 6), and cottonwood/willow (type 4).  

The Rawah and Comanche Peak areas would tend to be more typical of the overall dataset than either the Neota or Cache la Poudre, due to their assortment of tree species and range of predictive variable values (elevation, etc.)  Cache la Poudre would probably  be more unique than the others, due to its relatively low  elevation range and species composition.

Important note: The 7th field (selector) has been widely misinterpreted in the past as a dependent variable representing presence or absence of a liver disorder. This is incorrect [1]. The 7th field was created by BUPA researchers as a train/test selector. It is not suitable as a dependent variable for classification. The dataset does not contain any variable representing presence or absence of a liver disorder. Researchers who wish to use this dataset as a classification benchmark should follow the method used in experiments by the donor (Forsyth & Rada, 1986, Machine learning: applications in expert systems and information retrieval) and others (e.g. Turney, 1995, Cost-sensitive classification: Empirical evaluation of a hybrid genetic decision tree induction algorithm), who used the 6th field (drinks), after dichotomising, as a dependent variable for classification.

183,2024-10-28 15:48:28,Communities and Crime,7/12/2009,"Communities within the United States. The data combines socio-economic data from the 1990 US Census, law enforcement data from the 1990 US LEMAS survey, and crime data from the 1995 FBI UCR.",Multivariate,Social Science,Regression,Real,1994,127,"  Many variables are included so that algorithms that select or learn weights for attributes could be tested. However, clearly unrelated attributes were not included; attributes were picked if there was any plausible connection to crime (N=122), plus the attribute to be predicted (Per Capita Violent Crimes). The variables included in the dataset involve the community, such as the percent of the population considered urban, and the median family income, and involving law enforcement, such as per capita number of police officers, and percent of officers assigned to drug units. 
 
 The per capita violent crimes variable was calculated using population and the sum of crime variables considered violent crimes in the United States: murder, rape, robbery, and assault. There was apparently some controversy in some states concerning the counting of rapes. These resulted in missing values for rape, which resulted in incorrect values for per capita violent crime. These cities are not included in the dataset. Many of these omitted communities were from the midwestern USA.

  Data is described below based on original values. All numeric data was normalized into the decimal range  0.00-1.00 using an Unsupervised, equal-interval binning method. Attributes retain their distribution and skew (hence for example the population attribute has a mean value of  0.06 because most communities are small). E.g. An attribute described as 'mean people per household' is actually the normalized (0-1) version of that value.

  The normalization preserves rough ratios of values WITHIN an attribute (e.g. double the value for double the population within the available precision - except for extreme values (all values more than 3 SD above the mean are normalized to 1.00; all values more than 3 SD below the mean are nromalized to  0.00)).

  However, the normalization does not preserve relationships between values BETWEEN attributes (e.g. it would not be meaningful to compare the value for whitePerCap with the value for blackPerCap for a community)

  A limitation was that the LEMAS survey was of the police departments with at least 100 officers, plus a random sample of smaller departments. For our purposes, communities not found in both census and crime datasets were omitted. Many communities are missing LEMAS data.

Features consist of hourly average ambient variables Temperature (T), Ambient Pressure (AP), Relative Humidity (RH) and Exhaust Vacuum (V) to predict the net hourly electrical energy output (EP)  of the plant.
A combined cycle power plant (CCPP) is composed of gas turbines (GT), steam turbines (ST) and heat recovery steam generators. In a CCPP, the electricity is generated by gas and steam turbines, which are combined in one cycle, and is transferred from one turbine to another. While the Vacuum is colected from and has effect on the Steam Turbine, he other three of the ambient variables effect the GT performance.
For comparability with our baseline studies, and to allow 5x2 fold statistical tests be carried out, we provide the data shuffled five times. For each shuffling 2-fold CV is carried out and the resulting 10 measurements are used for statistical testing.

For each respondent 12 attributes are known: Personality measurements which include NEO-FFI-R (neuroticism, extraversion, openness to experience, agreeableness, and conscientiousness), BIS-11 (impulsivity), and ImpSS (sensation seeking), level of education, age, gender, country of residence and ethnicity. All input attributes are originally categorical and are quantified. After quantification values of all input features can be considered as real-valued. In addition, participants were questioned concerning their use of 18 legal and illegal drugs (alcohol, amphetamines, amyl nitrite, benzodiazepine, cannabis, chocolate, cocaine, caffeine, crack, ecstasy, heroin, ketamine, legal highs, LSD, methadone, mushrooms, nicotine and volatile substance abuse and one fictitious drug (Semeron) which was introduced to identify over-claimers. For each drug they have to select one of the answers: never used the drug, used it over a decade ago, or in the last decade, year, month, week, or day.
Database contains 18 classification problems. Each of independent label variables contains seven classes: ""Never Used"", ""Used over a Decade Ago"", ""Used in Last Decade"", ""Used in Last Year"", ""Used in Last Month"", ""Used in Last Week"", and ""Used in Last Day"".

Problem which can be solved:
* Seven class classifications for each drug separately.
* Problem can be transformed to binary classification by union of part of classes into one new class. For example, ""Never Used"", ""Used over a Decade Ago"" form class ""Non-user"" and all other classes form class ""User"".
* The best binarization of classes for each attribute.
* Evaluation of risk to be drug consumer for each drug.

Detailed description of database and process of data quantification are presented in E. Fehrman, A. K. Muhammad, E. M. Mirkes, V. Egan and A. N. Gorban, ""The Five Factor Model of personality and evaluation of drug consumption risk.,"" arXiv https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.06297, 2015

579,2024-10-28 15:49:27,Myocardial infarction complications,12/8/2020,Prediction of myocardial infarction complications,Multivariate,Health and Medicine,Classification,Real,1700,111,"Problems of real-life complexity are needed to test and compare various data mining and pattern recognition methods. The proposed database can be used to solve two practically important problems: predicting complications of Myocardial Infarction (MI) based on information about the patient (i) at the time of admission and (ii) on the third day of the hospital period. Another important group of tasks is phenotyping of disease (cluster analysis), dynamic phenotyping (filament extraction and identification of disease trajectories) and visualisation (disease mapping). 
MI is one of the most challenging problems of modern medicine. Acute myocardial infarction is associated with high mortality in the first year after it. The incidence of MI remains high in all countries. This is especially true for the urban population of highly developed countries, which is exposed to chronic stress factors, irregular and not always balanced nutrition. In the United States, for example, more than a million people suffer from MI every year, and 200-300 thousand of them die from acute MI before arriving at the hospital. 
The course of the disease in patients with MI is different. MI can occur without complications or with complications that do not worsen the long-term prognosis. At the same time, about half of patients in the acute and subacute periods have complications that lead to worsening of the disease and even death. Even an experienced specialist can not always foresee the development of these complications. In this regard, predicting complications of myocardial infarction in order to timely carry out the necessary preventive measures is an important task. 

Problems to solve
In general columns 2-112 can be used as input data for prediction. Possible complications (outputs) are listed in columns 113-124.
There are four possible time moments for complication prediction: on base of the information known at
1. the time of admission to hospital: all input columns (2-112) except 93, 94, 95, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105 can be used for prediction;
2. the end of the first day (24 hours after admission to the hospital): all input columns (2-112) except 94, 95, 101, 102, 104, 105 can be used for prediction;
3. the end of the second day (48 hours after admission to the hospital) all input columns (2-112) except 95, 102, 105 can be used for prediction;
4. the end of the third day (72 hours after admission to the hospital) all input columns (2-112) can be used for prediction.

Each pattern is a set of 60 numbers in the range 0.0 to 1.0.  Each number represents the energy within a particular frequency band, integrated over a certain period of time.  The integration aperture for higher frequencies occur later in time, since these frequencies are transmitted later during the chirp.

The recordings were automatically captured in the patient's homes.

Columns in the table contain subject number, subject age, subject gender, time interval from baseline recruitment date, motor UPDRS, total UPDRS, and 16 biomedical voice measures. Each row corresponds to one of 5,875 voice recording from these individuals. The main aim of the data is to predict the motor and total UPDRS scores ('motor_UPDRS' and 'total_UPDRS') from the 16 voice measures.

The data is in ASCII CSV format. The rows of the CSV file contain an instance corresponding to one voice recording. There are around 200 recordings per patient, the subject number of the patient is identified in the first column.

The input data consists of daily samples for 36 sites, providing measurements related to pH values in Georgia, USA. The input features consist of 11 common indices including volume of dissolved oxygen, temperature, and specific conductance (see details in dataset). The output to predict is the measurement of 'pH, water, unfiltered, field, standard units (Median)'. There are two major water systems to consider: one is centered on the city of Atlanta while the other is centered on the eastern coast of Georgia.

The dataset consists of 1516948data points collected at 0.1Hz  from February to August 2020 and is described by 15 features from 7 analogue (1-7) and 8 digital (8-15) sensors:
1. TP2 (bar) â the measure of the pressure on the compressor.
2. TP3 (bar) â the measure of the pressure generated at the pneumatic panel.
3. H1 (bar) â the measure of the pressure generated due to pressure drop when the discharge of the cyclonic separator filter occurs.
4. DV pressure (bar) â the measure of the pressure drop generated when the towers discharge air dryers; a zero reading indicates that the compressor is operating under load.
5. Reservoirs (bar) â the measure of the downstream pressure of the reservoirs, which should be close to the pneumatic panel pressure (TP3).
6. Motor Current (A) â  the measure of the current of one phase of the three-phase motor; it presents values close to 0A - when it turns off, 4A - when working offloaded, 7A - when working under load, and 9A - when it starts working.
7. Oil Temperature (ÂºC) â  the measure of the oil temperature on the compressor.
8. COMP - the electrical signal of the air intake valve on the compressor; it is active when there is no air intake, indicating that the compressor is either turned off or operating in an offloaded state.
9. DV electric â the electrical signal that controls the compressor outlet valve; it is active when the compressor is functioning under load and inactive when the compressor is either off or operating in an offloaded state.
10. TOWERS â the electrical signal that defines the tower responsible for drying the air and the tower responsible for draining the humidity removed from the air; when not active, it indicates that tower one is functioning; when active, it indicates that tower two is in operation.
11. MPG â the electrical signal responsible for starting the compressor under load by activating the intake valve when the pressure in the air production unit (APU) falls below 8.2 bar; it activates the COMP sensor, which assumes the same behaviour as the MPG sensor.
12. LPS â the electrical signal that detects and activates when the pressure drops below 7 bars.
13. Pressure Switch - the electrical signal that detects the discharge in the air-drying towers.
14. Oil Level â the electrical signal that detects the oil level on the compressor; it is active when the oil is below the expected values.
15. Caudal Impulse â the electrical signal that counts the pulse outputs generated by the absolute amount of air flowing from the APU to the reservoirs.",,,,,,1 citations,21161 views

121,2024-10-28 15:51:07,EEG Database,10/12/1999,This data arises from a large study to examine EEG correlates of genetic predisposition to alcoholism. It contains measurements from 64 electrodes placed on the scalp sampled at 256 Hz,"Multivariate, Time-Series",Health and Medicine,Classification,"Categorical, Integer, Real",122,-,"This data arises from a large study to examine EEG correlates of genetic predisposition to alcoholism. It contains measurements from 64 electrodes placed on subject's scalps which were sampled at 256 Hz (3.9-msec epoch) for 1 second. 

There were two groups of subjects: alcoholic and control. Each subject was exposed to either a single stimulus (S1) or to two stimuli (S1 and S2) which were pictures of objects chosen from the 1980 Snodgrass and Vanderwart picture set. When two stimuli were shown, they were presented in either a matched condition where S1 was identical to S2 or in a non-matched condition where S1 differed from S2. 

Shown here are example plots of a control (http://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/eeg/control.gif) and alcoholic (http://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/eeg/alcoholic.gif) subject. The plots indicate voltage, time, and channel and are averaged over 10 trials for the single stimulus condition. 

There were 122 subjects and each subject completed 120 trials where different stimuli were shown. The electrode positions were located at standard sites (Standard Electrode Position Nomenclature, American Electroencephalographic Association 1990). Zhang et al. (1995) describes in detail the data collection process. 

There are three versions of the EEG data set. 

1. The Small Data Set
The small data set (smni97_eeg_data.tar.gz) contains data for the 2 subjects, alcoholic a_co2a0000364 and control c_co2c0000337. For each of the 3 matching paradigms, c_1 (one presentation only), c_m (match to previous presentation) and c_n (no-match to previous presentation), 10 runs are shown. 

2.  The Large Data Set
The large data set (SMNI_CMI_TRAIN.tar.gz and SMNI_CMI_TEST.tar.gz) contains data for 10 alcoholic and 10 control subjects, with 10 runs per subject per paradigm. The test data used the same 10 alcoholic and 10 control subjects as with the training data, but with 10 out-of-sample runs per subject per paradigm. 

3. The Full Data Set
This data set contains all 120 trials for 122 subjects. The entire set of data is about 700 MBytes. 

NOTE: There are 17 trials with empty files in co2c1000367. Some trials have ""err"" notices, e.g., search/grep for ""err"" and see ""S2 match err"" or ""S2 nomatch err"" etc. ",Yes ,"Variable Name Role Type Description Units Missing Values

Many different methods have been used in this regard; however, it has not yet been possible to achieve 100% success. Mine detection process consists of sensor design, data analysis and decision algorithm phases. The magnetic anomaly method works according to the principle of measuring the anomalies resulting from the object in the magnetic field that disturbs the structure of it, the magnetic field, and the data obtained at this point are used to determine the conditions such as motion and position. The determination of parameters such as position, depth or direction of motion using magnetic anomaly has been carried out since 1970.","Tabular, Multivariate, Other",Engineering,"Classification, Clustering","Real, Integer",338,3,PhD thesis,"Cemal YILMAZ

76,2024-10-28 15:51:53,Nursery,5/31/1997,Nursery Database was derived from a hierarchical decision model originally developed to rank applications for nursery schools.,Multivariate,Social Science,Classification,Categorical,12960,8,"Nursery Database was derived from a hierarchical decision model originally developed to rank applications for nursery schools. It was used during several years in 1980's when there was excessive enrollment to these schools in Ljubljana, Slovenia, and the rejected applications frequently needed an objective explanation. The final decision depended on three subproblems: occupation of parents and child's nursery, family structure and financial standing, and social and health picture of the family. The model was developed within expert system shell for decision making DEX (M. Bohanec, V. Rajkovic: Expert system for decision making. Sistemica 1(1), pp. 145-157, 1990.).

The hierarchical model ranks nursery-school applications according to the following concept structure:

 NURSERY            Evaluation of applications for nursery schools
 . EMPLOY           Employment of parents and child's nursery
 . . parents        Parents' occupation
 . . has_nurs       Child's nursery
 . STRUCT_FINAN     Family structure and financial standings
 . . STRUCTURE      Family structure
 . . . form         Form of the family
 . . . children     Number of children
 . . housing        Housing conditions
 . . finance        Financial standing of the family
 . SOC_HEALTH       Social and health picture of the family
 . . social         Social conditions
 . . health         Health conditions

Input attributes are printed in lowercase. Besides the target concept (NURSERY) the model includes four intermediate concepts: EMPLOY, STRUCT_FINAN, STRUCTURE, SOC_HEALTH. Every concept is in the original model related to its lower level descendants by a set of examples (for these examples sets see http://www-ai.ijs.si/BlazZupan/nursery.html).

The Nursery Database contains examples with the structural information removed, i.e., directly relates NURSERY to the eight input attributes: parents, has_nurs, form, children, housing, finance, social, health.

Because of known underlying concept structure, this database may be particularly useful for testing constructive induction and structure discovery methods.",No,"An application for admission in public school systems

The differential diagnosis of erythemato-squamous diseases is a real problem in dermatology. They all share the clinical features of erythema and scaling, with very little differences. The diseases in this group are psoriasis, seboreic dermatitis, lichen planus, pityriasis rosea, cronic dermatitis, and pityriasis rubra pilaris. Usually a biopsy is necessary for the diagnosis but unfortunately these diseases share many histopathological features as well. Another difficulty for the differential diagnosis is that a disease may show the features of another disease at the beginning stage and may have the characteristic features at the following stages. Patients were first evaluated clinically with 12 features. Afterwards, skin samples were taken for the evaluation of 22 histopathological features. The values of the histopathological features are determined by an analysis of the samples under a microscope. 

In the dataset constructed for this domain, the family history feature has the value 1 if any of these diseases has been observed in the family, and 0 otherwise. The age feature simply represents the age of the patient. Every other feature (clinical and histopathological) was given a degree in the range of 0 to 3. Here, 0 indicates that the feature was not present, 3 indicates the largest amount possible, and 1, 2 indicate the relative intermediate values.

The setup consisted of 7 sensor nodes and one edge node in a star configuration with the sensor nodes transmitting data to the edge every 30s using wireless transceivers. No HVAC systems were in use while the dataset was being collected.

Five different types of non-intrusive sensors were used in this experiment: temperature, light, sound, CO2 and digital passive infrared (PIR). The CO2, sound and PIR sensors needed manual calibration. For the CO2 sensor, zero-point calibration was manually done before its first use by keeping it in a clean environment for over 20 minutes and then pulling the calibration pin (HD pin) low for over 7s. The sound sensor is essentially a microphone with a variable-gain analog amplifier attached to it. Therefore, the output of this sensor is analog which is read by the microcontrollerÃ¢â¬â¢s ADC in volts. The potentiometer tied to the gain of the amplifier was adjusted to ensure the highest sensitivity. The PIR sensor has two trimpots: one to tweak the sensitivity and the other to tweak the time for which the output stays high after detecting motion. Both of these were adjusted to the highest values. Sensor nodes S1-S4 consisted of temperature, light and sound sensors, S5 had a CO2 sensor and S6 and S7 had one PIR sensor each that were deployed on the ceiling ledges at an angle that maximized the sensorÃ¢â¬â¢s field of view for motion detection.

The data was collected for a period of 4 days in a controlled manner with the occupancy in the room varying between 0 and 3 people. The ground truth of the occupancy count in the room was noted manually.

The separation described above was obtained using Multisurface Method-Tree (MSM-T) [K. P. Bennett, ""Decision Tree Construction Via Linear Programming."" Proceedings of the 4th Midwest Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Science Society, pp. 97-101, 1992], a classification method which uses linear programming to construct a decision tree.  Relevant features were selected using an exhaustive search in the space of 1-4 features and 1-3 separating planes.

The actual linear program used to obtain the separating plane in the 3-dimensional space is that described in: 
[K. P. Bennett and O. L. Mangasarian: ""Robust Linear Programming Discrimination of Two Linearly Inseparable Sets"", Optimization Methods and Software 1, 1992, 23-34].

There is information on actors, casts, directors, producers, studios, etc.","Multivariate, Relational",Other,-,-,10000,-,"The data is stored in relational form across several files. The central file (MAIN) is a list of movies, each with a unique identifier. These identifiers may change in successive versions. The actors (CAST) for those movies are listed with their roles in a distinct file. More information about individual actors (ACTORS) is in a third file. All directors in MAIN are listed in a fourth file (PEOPLE), with a number of important producers, writers, and cinematographers. A fifth file (REMAKES) links movies that were copied to a substantial extent from each other. The sixth file (STUDIOS) provides some information about studios shown in MAIN.

The original motivation was for database class exercises, to replace the boring `manager of the toy-department' queries. Note that the CASTS, refering MAIN and ACTORS is logically identical to the inventory file refering to suppliers and assemblies in the the standard bill-of-materials problems. Personal interests caused the database to be made complete for all Hitchcock movies and TV episodes. Related films by type and actor were added gradually.

Subsequent research on temporal databases caused date fields (years only) to be added. It allows testing, say, if the dates-of-work of an ACTOR match the dates of the MAIN films that the CAST relation shows. Object-oriented database features could be tested with fields having multiple and two-level values, as documented in DOC.

The entries were gradually collected during course work starting about 1975 and are still being updated. Most of the entries were manual. The DOC file lists some of the reference works used. Corrections and additions continue to be appreciated.

Detailed descriptions of the fields and their formats is provided in doc.html. 

Missing Values:

Outside of key fields, missing values are common. Their encoding is described in DOC. Sometimes the data seems to be unavailable, sometimes it hasn't been entered. Some information, as `lived-with' is inherently incomplete.

Censored Data:

Minor actors are ignored.

Dependencies:

Every MAIN film must have a director in PEOPLE. About 50 pseudo director names ahve been listed in PEOPLE to allow interesting films to with (yet) unknown directors to be entered. Every CASTS entry must relate to a MAIN film entry. Every ACTOR should appear in some CASTS entry, but not vice versa. See DOC for more type information.

Other Relevant Information:

Films are listed, if known, with their original language title. An Alt(T: ) field provides English translations, where known.

The current files are in HTML, to allow easy parsing to other formats. An XML version is being considered.

179,2024-10-28 15:54:02,SECOM,11/18/2008,Data from a semi-conductor manufacturing process,Multivariate,Computer Science,"Classification, Causal-Discovery",Real,1567,591,"A complex modern semi-conductor manufacturing process is normally under consistent surveillance via the monitoring of signals/variables collected from sensors and or process measurement points. However, not all of these signals are equally valuable in a specific monitoring system. The measured signals contain a combination of useful information, irrelevant information as well as noise. It is often the case that useful information is buried in the latter two. Engineers typically have a much larger number of signals than are actually required. If we consider each type of signal as a feature, then feature selection may be applied to identify the most relevant signals. The Process Engineers may then use these signals to determine key factors contributing to yield excursions downstream in the process. This will enable an increase in process throughput, decreased time to learning and reduce the per unit production costs.

To enhance current business improvement techniques the application of feature selection as an intelligent systems technique is being investigated.

The dataset presented in this case represents a selection of such features where each example represents a single production entity with associated measured features and the labels represent a simple pass/fail yield for in house line testing, figure 2, and associated date time stamp. Where â1 corresponds to a pass and 1 corresponds to a fail and the data time stamp is for that specific test point.


Using feature selection techniques it is desired to rank features according to their impact on the overall yield for the product, causal relationships may also be considered with a view to identifying the key features.

Results may be submitted in terms of feature relevance for predictability using error rates as our evaluation metrics. It is suggested that cross validation be applied to generate these results. Some baseline results are shown below for basic feature selection techniques using a simple kernel ridge classifier and 10 fold cross validation.

Baseline Results: Pre-processing objects were applied to the dataset simply to standardize the data and remove the constant features and then a number of different feature selection objects selecting 40 highest ranked features were applied with a simple classifier to achieve some initial results. 10 fold cross validation was used and the balanced error rate (*BER) generated as our initial performance metric to help investigate this dataset.

   (c) Indication of study's results
       The study decomposed each time series into 10 second windows and performed binary classification to predict if windows corresponded to an intoxicated participant (TAC >= 0.08) or sober participant (TAC < 0.08). The study tested several models and achieved a test accuracy of 77.5% with a random forest.

Relevant Information:
    All data is fully anonymized.

    Data was originally collected from 19 participants, but the TAC readings of 6 participants were deemed unusable by SCRAM [1]. The data included is from the remaining 13 participants.
   
    Accelerometer data was collected from smartphones at a sampling rate of 40Hz (file: all_accelerometer_data_pids_13.csv). The file contains 5 columns: a timestamp, a participant ID, and a sample from each axis of the accelerometer. Data was collected from a mix of 11 iPhones and 2 Android phones as noted in phone_types.csv. TAC data was collected using SCRAM [2] ankle bracelets and was collected at 30 minute intervals. The raw TAC readings are in the raw_tac directory. TAC readings which are more readily usable for processing are in clean_tac directory and have two columns: a timestamp and TAC reading. The cleaned TAC readings: (1) were processed with a zero-phase low-pass filter to smooth noise without shifting phase; (2) were shifted backwards by 45 minutes so the labels more closely match the true intoxication of the participant (since alcohol takes about 45 minutes to exit through the skin.) Please see the above referenced study for more details on how the data was processed (http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2429/paper6.pdf).

319,2024-10-28 15:54:21,MHEALTH,12/6/2014,The MHEALTH (Mobile Health) dataset is devised to benchmark techniques dealing with human behavior analysis based on multimodal body sensing.,"Multivariate, Time-Series",Computer Science,Classification,Real,120,-,"The MHEALTH (Mobile HEALTH) dataset comprises body motion and vital signs recordings for ten volunteers of diverse profile while performing several physical activities. Sensors placed on the subject's chest, right wrist and left ankle are used to measure the motion experienced by diverse body parts, namely, acceleration, rate of turn and magnetic field orientation. The sensor positioned on the chest also provides 2-lead ECG measurements, which can be potentially used for basic heart monitoring, checking for various arrhythmias or looking at the effects of exercise on the ECG.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DATASET SUMMARY:
#Activities: 12 
#Sensor devices: 3
#Subjects: 10
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EXPERIMENTAL SETUP
The collected dataset comprises body motion and vital signs recordings for ten volunteers of diverse profile while performing 12 physical activities (Table 1). Shimmer2 [BUR10] wearable sensors were used for the recordings. The sensors were respectively placed on the subject's chest, right wrist and left ankle and attached by using elastic straps (as shown in the figure in attachment). The use of multiple sensors permits us to measure the motion experienced by diverse body parts, namely, the acceleration, the rate of turn and the magnetic field orientation, thus better capturing the body dynamics. The sensor positioned on the chest also provides 2-lead ECG measurements which are not used for the development of the recognition model but rather collected for future work purposes. This information can be used, for example, for basic heart monitoring, checking for various arrhythmias or looking at the effects of exercise on the ECG. All sensing modalities are recorded at a sampling rate of 50 Hz, which is considered sufficient for capturing human activity. Each session was recorded using a video camera. This dataset is found to generalize to common activities of the daily living, given the diversity of body parts involved in each one (e.g., frontal elevation of arms vs. knees bending), the intensity of the actions (e.g., cycling vs. sitting and relaxing) and their execution speed or dynamicity (e.g., running vs. standing still). The activities were collected in an out-of-lab environment with no constraints on the way these must be executed, with the exception that the subject should try their best when executing them.

ACTIVITY SET
The activity set is listed in the following:
L1: Standing still (1 min) 
L2: Sitting and relaxing (1 min) 
L3: Lying down (1 min) 
L4: Walking (1 min) 
L5: Climbing stairs (1 min) 
L6: Waist bends forward (20x) 
L7: Frontal elevation of arms (20x)
L8: Knees bending (crouching) (20x)
L9: Cycling (1 min)
L10: Jogging (1 min)
L11: Running (1 min)
L12: Jump front & back (20x)

Five Xsens MTx units are used on the torso, arms, and legs.","Multivariate, Time-Series",Computer Science,"Classification, Clustering",Real,9120,5625,"Brief Description of the Dataset:
---------------------------------
Each of the 19 activities is performed by eight subjects (4 female, 4 male, between the ages 20 and 30) for 5 minutes.
Total signal duration is 5 minutes for each activity of each subject.
The subjects are asked to perform the activities in their own style and were not restricted on how the activities should be performed. For this reason, there are inter-subject variations in the speeds and amplitudes of some activities. 
The activities are performed at the Bilkent University Sports Hall, in the Electrical and Electronics Engineering Building, 
and in a flat outdoor area on campus. Sensor units are calibrated to acquire data at 25 Hz sampling frequency. The 5-min signals are divided into 5-sec segments so that 480(=60x8) signal segments are obtained for each activity.

The 19 activities are: 
sitting (A1), 
standing (A2), 
lying on back and on right side (A3 and A4), 
ascending and descending stairs (A5 and A6), 
standing in an elevator still (A7) 
and moving around in an elevator (A8), 
walking in a parking lot (A9), 
walking on a treadmill with a speed of 4 km/h (in flat and 15 deg inclined positions) (A1
0 and A11),
running on a treadmill with a speed of 8 km/h (A12), 
exercising on a stepper (A13), 
exercising on a cross trainer (A14), 
cycling on an exercise bike in horizontal and vertical positions (A15 and A16),
rowing (A17), 
jumping (A18), 
and playing basketball (A19).

File structure:

19 activities (a) (in the order given above)
 8 subjects   (p)
60 segments   (s)
 5 units on torso (T), right arm (RA), left arm (LA), right leg (RL), left leg (LL)
 9 sensors on each unit (x,y,z accelerometers, x,y,z gyroscopes, x,y,z magnetometers)
 
Folders a01, a02, ..., a19 contain data recorded from the 19 activities.

For each activity, the subfolders p1, p2, ..., p8 contain data from each of the 8 subjects.

In each subfolder, there are 60 text files s01, s02, ..., s60, one for each segment.

In each text file, there are 5 units x 9 sensors = 45 columns and 5 sec x 25 Hz = 125 rows.
Each column contains the 125 samples of data acquired from one of the sensors of one of the units over a period of 5 sec.
Each row contains data acquired from all of the 45 sensor axes at a particular sampling instant separated by commas.

Columns 1-45 correspond to:  
 T_xacc,  T_yacc,  T_zacc,  T_xgyro, ...,  T_ymag,  T_zmag,
RA_xacc, RA_yacc, RA_zacc, RA_xgyro, ..., RA_ymag, RA_zmag,
LA_xacc, LA_yacc, LA_zacc, LA_xgyro, ..., LA_ymag, LA_zmag,

LL_xacc, LL_yacc, LL_zacc, LL_xgyro, ..., LL_ymag, LL_zmag.

Therefore,
columns  1-9  correspond to the sensors in unit 1 (T), 
columns 10-18 correspond to the sensors in unit 2 (RA), 
columns 19-27 correspond to the sensors in unit 3 (LA), 
columns 28-36 correspond to the sensors in unit 4 (RL), 
columns 37-45 correspond to the sensors in unit 5 (LL). ",No,"Comparative study on classifying human activities with miniature inertial and magnetic sensors

However, optimizing energy output in large wave farms presents a complex problem due to the expensive calculations required to account for hydrodynamic interactions between wave energy converters (WECs). Developing a fast and accurate surrogate model is crucial to overcome these challenges. In light of this, we have compiled an extensive WEC dataset that includes 54,000 and 9,600 configurations involving 49 and 100 WECs, coordination, power, q-factor, and total farm power output. The dataset was derived from a study published at the GECCO conference and received the prestigious Best Paper award. We want to acknowledge the support of the University of Adelaide Phoenix HPC service in conducting this research.

390,2024-10-28 15:58:00,Stock Portfolio Performance,4/21/2016,The data set of performances of weighted scoring stock portfolios are obtained with mixture design from the US stock market historical database.,Multivariate,Business,Regression,Real,315,12,"There are three disadvantages of weighted scoring stock selection models. First, they cannot identify the relations between weights of stock-picking concepts and performances of portfolios. Second, they cannot systematically discover the optimal combination for weights of concepts to optimize the performances. Third, they are unable to meet various investorsÃ¢â¬â¢ preferences. This study aims to more efficiently construct weighted scoring stock selection models to overcome these disadvantages. Since the weights of stock-picking concepts in a weighted scoring stock selection model can be regarded as components in a mixture, we used the simplex centroid mixture design to obtain the experimental sets of weights. These sets of weights are simulated with US stock market historical data to obtain their performances. Performance prediction models were built with the simulated performance data set and artificial neural networks. Furthermore, the optimization models to reflect investorsÃ¢â¬â¢ preferences were built up, and the performance prediction models were employed as the kernel of the optimization models so that the optimal solutions can now be solved with optimization techniques. The empirical values of the performances of the optimal weighting combinations generated by the optimization models showed that they can meet various investorsÃ¢â¬â¢ preferences and outperform those of S&PÃ¢â¬â¢s 500 not only during the training period but also during the testing period.",No,"Using mixture design and neural networks to build stock selection decision support systems

There are 32 images for each person capturing every combination of features. 

To view the images, you can use the program xv. 

The image data can be found in /faces. This directory contains 20 subdirectories, one for each person, named by userid. Each of these directories contains several different face images of the same person. 

You will be interested in the images with the following naming convention: 

<userid> <pose> <expression> <eyes> <scale>.pgm 
<userid> is the user id of the person in the image, and this field has 20 values: an2i, at33, boland, bpm, ch4f, cheyer, choon, danieln, glickman, karyadi, kawamura, kk49, megak, mitchell, night, phoebe, saavik, steffi, sz24, and tammo. 
<pose> is the head position of the person, and this field has 4 values: straight, left, right, up. 
<expression> is the facial expression of the person, and this field has 4 values: neutral, happy, sad, angry. 
<eyes> is the eye state of the person, and this field has 2 values: open, sunglasses. 
<scale> is the scale of the image, and this field has 3 values: 1, 2, and 4. 1 indicates a full-resolution image (128 columns by 120 rows); 2 indicates a half-resolution image (64 by 60); 4 indicates a quarter-resolution image (32 by 30). 
If you've been looking closely in the image directories, you may notice that some images have a .bad suffix rather than the .pgm suffix. As it turns out, 16 of the 640 images taken have glitches due to problems with the camera setup; these are the .bad images. Some people had more glitches than others, but everyone who got ``faced'' should have at least 28 good face images (out of the 32 variations possible, discounting scale).

The dataset includes reconnaissance, MitM, DoS, and botnet attacks.","Multivariate, Sequential, Time-Series",Computer Science,"Classification, Clustering, Causal-Discovery",Real,27170754,7,"==== Overview ====
The are 9 network capture datasets in total, listed below. Viol. is the security violation (Confidentiality, Integrity, and Authenticity).

Botnet Malware 
   -9  Mirai  Telnet  C,I infects IoT with the Mirai malware by exploiting default credentials, and then scans for new vulnerable victims network.

-For more details on the attacks themselves, please refer to our paper. 

==== Data Organization ====
For each attack (network capture) above we provide (1) a csv of the features used in our paper where each row is a network packet, (2) the corresponding labels [benign, malicious], and (3) the original network capture in truncated pcap format.

-Each attack dataset is located in a separate directory
-Each directory contains three files:
 <Attack>_pcap.pcapng : A raw pcap capture of the original N packets. The packets have been truncated to 200 bytes for privacy reasons.
 <Attack>_dataset.csv : An N-by-M matrix of M-sized feature vectors, each describing the packet and the context of that packet's channel (see our paper for details).
 <Attack>_labels.csv : An N-by-1 vector of 0-1 values which indicate whether each packet in <Attack>_pcap.pcapng (and <Attack>_dataset.csv) is malicious ('1') or not ('0'). For the Man-in-middle-Attacks, all packets which have passed through the MitM are marked as '1'.
-Every attack dataset begins with benign traffic, and then at some point (1) the attacker connects to the network and (2) initiates the given attack.",No,"=== The features in the csv files ===
Each row in the csv is a packet captured (chronologically). More a deep explanation, please see our paper. 
In general, each row (feature vector) are recent (temporal) statistics which describes the context of the packet's channel and its communicating parties:

Whenever a packet arrives, we extract a behavioral snapshot of the hosts and protocols which communicated the given packet. The snapshot consists of 115 traffic statistics capturing a small temporal window into: (1) the packet's sender in general, and (2) the traffic between the packet's sender and receiver.

Specifically, the statistics summarize all of the traffic...
  ...originating from this packet's source MAC and IP address (denoted SrcMAC-IP).
  ...originating from this packet's source IP (denoted SrcIP).
  ...sent between this packet's source and destination IPs (denoted Channel).  
  ...sent between this packet's source and destination TCP/UDP Socket (denoted Socket).

A total of 23 features (capturing the above) can be extracted from a single time window ÃÂ» (see Table II). The FE extracts the same set of features from a total of five time damped windows of approximately: 100ms, 500ms, 1.5sec, 10sec, and 1min into the past (ÃÂ» = 5, 3, 1, 0.1, 0.01), thus totaling 115 features.

We note that not every packet applies to every channel type (e.g., there is no socket if the packet does not contain a TCP or UDP datagram). In these cases, these features are zeroed. Thus, the final feature vector ~x, which the FE passes to the
FM, is always a member of R^n, where n = 115.

81,2024-10-28 15:58:23,Pen-Based Recognition of Handwritten Digits,6/30/1998,Digit database of 250 samples from 44 writers,Multivariate,Computer Science,Classification,Integer,10992,16,"We create a digit database by collecting 250 samples from 44 writers. The samples written by 30 writers are used for training, cross-validation and writer dependent testing, and the digits written by the other 14 are used for writer independent testing. This database is also available in the UNIPEN format.

We use a WACOM PL-100V pressure sensitive tablet with an integrated LCD display and a cordless stylus. The input and display areas are located in the same place. Attached to the serial port of an Intel 486 based PC, it allows us to collect handwriting samples. The tablet sends $x$ and $y$ tablet coordinates and pressure level values of the pen at fixed time intervals (sampling rate) of 100 miliseconds. 

These writers are asked to write 250 digits in random order inside boxes of 500 by 500 tablet pixel resolution.  Subject are monitored only during the first entry screens. Each screen contains five boxes with the digits to be written displayed above. Subjects are told to write only inside these boxes.  If they make a mistake or are unhappy with their writing, they are instructed to clear the content of a box by using an on-screen button. The first ten digits are ignored because most writers are not familiar with this type of input devices, but subjects are not aware of this. 

In our study, we use only ($x, y$) coordinate information. The stylus pressure level values are ignored. First we apply normalization to make our representation invariant to translations and scale distortions. The raw data that we capture from the tablet consist of integer values between 0 and 500 (tablet input box resolution). The new coordinates are such that the coordinate which has the maximum range varies between 0 and 100. Usually $x$ stays in this range, since most characters are taller than they are wide.  

In order to train and test our classifiers, we need to represent digits as constant length feature vectors. A commonly used technique leading to good results is resampling the ( x_t, y_t) points. Temporal resampling (points regularly spaced in time) or spatial resampling (points regularly spaced in arc length) can be used here. Raw point data are already regularly spaced in time but the distance between them is variable. Previous research showed that spatial resampling to obtain a constant number of regularly spaced points on the trajectory yields much better performance, because it provides a better alignment between points. Our resampling algorithm uses simple linear interpolation between pairs of points. The resampled digits are represented as a sequence of T points ( x_t, y_t )_{t=1}^T, regularly spaced in arc length, as opposed to the input sequence, which is regularly spaced in time.

So, the input vector size is 2*T, two times the number of points resampled. We considered spatial resampling to T=8,12,16 points in our experiments and found that T=8 gave the best trade-off between accuracy and complexity.",No,"Variable Name Role Type Description Units Missing Values

available today. However, the low positive predictive value of breast
biopsy resulting from mammogram interpretation leads to approximately
70% unnecessary biopsies with benign outcomes. To reduce the high
number of unnecessary breast biopsies, several computer-aided diagnosis
(CAD) systems have been proposed in the last years.These systems
help physicians in their decision to perform a breast biopsy on a suspicious
lesion seen in a mammogram or to perform a short term follow-up
examination instead.
This data set can be used to predict the severity (benign or malignant)
of a mammographic mass lesion from BI-RADS attributes and the patient's age.
It contains a BI-RADS assessment, the patient's age and three BI-RADS attributes
together with the ground truth (the severity field) for 516 benign and
445 malignant masses that have been identified on full field digital mammograms
collected at the Institute of Radiology of the
University Erlangen-Nuremberg between 2003 and 2006.
Each instance has an associated BI-RADS assessment ranging from 1 (definitely benign)
to 5 (highly suggestive of malignancy) assigned in a double-review process by
physicians. Assuming that all cases with BI-RADS assessments greater or equal
a given value (varying from 1 to 5), are malignant and the other cases benign,
sensitivities and associated specificities can be calculated. These can be an
indication of how well a CAD system performs compared to the radiologists.

312,2024-10-28 15:58:37,Dow Jones Index,10/22/2014,This dataset contains weekly data for the Dow Jones Industrial Index. It has been used in computational investing research.,Time-Series,Business,"Classification, Clustering","Integer, Real",750,15,"In predicting stock prices you collect data over some period of time - day, week, month, etc. But you cannot take advantage of data from a time period until the next increment of the time period. For example, assume you collect data daily.  When Monday is over you have all of the data for that day.  However you can invest on Monday, because you don't get the data until the end of the day.  You can use the data from Monday to invest on Tuesday.  

In our research each record (row) is data for a week.  Each record also has the percentage of return that stock has in the following week (percent_change_next_weeks_price). Ideally, you want to determine which stock will produce the greatest rate of return in the following week.  This can help you train and test your algorithm.

Some of these attributes might not be use used in your research.  They were originally added to our database to perform calculations.  (Brown, Pelosi & Dirska, 2013) used percent_change_price, percent_change_volume_over_last_wk, days_to_next_dividend, and percent_return_next_dividend.  We left the other attributes in the dataset in case you wanted to use any of them. Of course what you want to maximize is percent_change_next_weeks_price.

Training data vs Test data:
In (Brown, Pelosi & Dirska, 2013) we used quarter 1 (Jan-Mar) data for training and quarter 2 (Apr-Jun) data for testing. 

Interesting data points:
If you use quarter 2 data for testing, you will notice something interesting in the week ending 5/27/2011 every Dow Jones Index stock lost money.",No,"Dynamic-Radius Species-Conserving Genetic Algorithm for the Financial Forecasting of Dow Jones Index Stocks

For which, pass, shoot and pick up the ball have 5. and hold and dribble there are 2. 
First of all, we gathered the 4 users who were willing to be our test samples. 
Then, one by one we made them do the following 5 activities: Pass, hold the ball, shoot pick up the ball, and dribble. 
Each activity had a different way of gathering its corresponding data. 

For holding the ball, we made the volunteer stand in one place in a holding position. 
Once ready, we run the app. After 5 seconds we stop it and save the data with the userÃ¢â¬â¢s first initial, 
the activity and the number of the trial. For this label we did a total of 3 trials for each person.

Next we started collecting the data of passing. The volunteer starts with the ball in a holding position. 
Next we run the app, for which after 3 seconds we tell the volunteer to pass the ball to one of us, once 
finish we stop the app. For this label we did a total of 5 trails for each person. 

Then, we collected the data of dribbling. The volunteers start with the ball in holding position. Then, 3 seconds
after we run the app we tell him to dribble and after 5 he started the dribbling we said to stop. 
Once he stops we go and stop the app. For this label we did a total of 3 trials for each person.

Continuing with the activity of shooting, we let the volunteer get ready in a holding position with the ball, and 
then we run the app. For which, he shoots immediately after we start the application. Once finish, we stop the app. 
For this label we did a total of 5 trials for each person. 

Finally, we gather the data of picking the ball. For this data, we just start the app, 
and after 3 seconds the user picks up the ball, and at the 6 seconds we stop the app gathering this range of data.
For this label we did a total of 5 trails for each person. 

Finally we did a different way of collecting the data. For which one user in a set of time did each activity spontanously. Every time he did an activity we 
collected the time for which he did it in a chronometer, and in a video all for which started closely at the same time.

The measurings have a temporal resolution of 20 seconds. The air and gas sensors measure temperature, humidity, CO2, CO and MOX readings. The data from the position sensors are binary; for each room, a 1 means that movement has been detected in that room while a 0 means that the sensor has gone back to baseline. The attached figure represents a simple layout of the monitored home as well as the sensors locations. The dataset also includes 19 days of measurements (from 2020-01-25 to 2020-02-13) where noone was occupying the room (except for an esporadic visit the 2020-01-29 at 15:), as reference data",Tabular,Engineering,Classification,Real,444631,10,"This dataset was created in order to build a model that could translate the information gathered by a gas array sensor installed in a single elder person living alone into a safety monitoring system.

(1) sentiment analysis of drug experience over multiple facets, i.e. sentiments learned on specific aspects such as effectiveness and side effects,
(2) the transferability of models among domains, i.e. conditions, and 
(3) the transferability of models among different data sources (see 'Drug Review Dataset (Drugs.com)').

The data is split into a train (75%) a test (25%) partition (see publication) and stored in two .tsv (tab-separated-values) files, respectively.

We carried out this study over a simulation environment named Deeds (Digital Electronics Education and Design Suite) which is used for e-learning in digital electronics. The environment provides learning materials through specialized browsers for the students, and asks them to solve various problems with different levels of difficulty. For more information about the Deeds simulator used for this course look at: http://www.esng.dibe.unige.it/deeds/

and to know more about the exercises contents of each session see 'exercises_info.txt'. 

Our data set contains the students' time series of activities during six sessions of laboratory sessions of the course of digital electronics. There are 6 folders containing the studentsÃ¢â¬â¢ data per session. Each 'Session' folder contains up to 99 CSV files each dedicated to a specific student log during that session. The number of files in each folder changes due to the number of students present in each session. Each file contains 13 features. See 'features_info.txt' for more details.

The prediction task is to determine whether a patient survived or is deceased at a time of about 9 days after collecting their medical record at the hospital. This is an important prediction problem in clinical medicine. Sepsis is a life-threatening condition triggered by an immune overreaction to infection, leading to organ failure or even death.

146,2024-10-28 16:06:52,Statlog (Landsat Satellite),2/12/1993,"Multi-spectral values of pixels in 3x3 neighbourhoods in a satellite image, and the classification associated with the central pixel in each neighbourhood",Multivariate,Climate and Environment,Classification,Integer,6435,36,"The database consists of the multi-spectral values of pixels in 3x3 neighbourhoods in a satellite image, and the classification associated with the central pixel in each neighbourhood. The aim is to predict this classification, given the multi-spectral values. In the sample database, the class of a pixel is coded as a number.

The Landsat satellite data is one of the many sources of information available for a scene. The interpretation of a scene by integrating spatial data of diverse types and resolutions including multispectral and radar data, maps indicating topography, land use etc. is expected to assume significant importance with the onset of an era characterised by integrative approaches to remote sensing (for example, NASA's Earth Observing System commencing this decade). Existing statistical methods are ill-equipped for handling such diverse data types. Note that this is not true for Landsat MSS data considered in isolation (as in this sample database). This data satisfies the important requirements of being numerical and at a single resolution, and standard maximum-likelihood classification performs very well. Consequently, for this data, it should be interesting to compare the performance of other methods against the statistical approach.

One frame of Landsat MSS imagery consists of four digital images of the same scene in different spectral bands. Two of these are in the visible region (corresponding approximately to green and red regions of the visible spectrum) and two are in the (near) infra-red. Each pixel is a 8-bit binary word, with 0 corresponding to black and 255 to white. The spatial resolution of a pixel is about 80m x 80m. Each image contains 2340 x 3380 such pixels.

The database is a (tiny) sub-area of a scene, consisting of 82 x 100 pixels. Each line of data corresponds to a 3x3 square neighbourhood of pixels completely contained within the 82x100 sub-area. Each line contains the pixel values in the four spectral bands (converted to ASCII) of each of the 9 pixels in the 3x3 neighbourhood and a number indicating the classification label of the central pixel. The number is a code for the following classes:

Number   Class
1   red soil
2   cotton crop
3   grey soil
4   damp grey soil
5   soil with vegetation stubble
6   mixture class (all types present)
7   very damp grey soil
 
NB. There are no examples with class 6 in this dataset.

The data is given in random order and certain lines of data have been removed so you cannot reconstruct the original image from this dataset.

In each line of data the four spectral values for the top-left pixel are given first followed by the four spectral values for the top-middle pixel and then those for the top-right pixel, and so on with the pixels read out in sequence left-to-right and top-to-bottom. Thus, the four spectral values for the central pixel are given by attributes 17,18,19 and 20. If you like you can use only these four attributes, while ignoring the others. This avoids the problem which arises when a 3x3 neighbourhood straddles a boundary.",No,"Variable Name Role Type Description Units Missing Values

Data combines socio-economic data from the '90 Census, law enforcement data from the 1990 Law Enforcement Management and Admin Stats survey, and crime data from the 1995 FBI UCR",Multivariate,Social Science,Regression,Real,2215,125,"The source datasets needed to be combined via programming. Many variables are included so that algorithms that select or learn weights for attributes could be tested. However, clearly unrelated attributes were not included; attributes were picked if there was any plausible connection to crime (N=125), plus the crime variables which are potential dependent variables. The variables included in the dataset involve the community, such as the percent of the population considered urban, and the median family income, and involving law enforcement, such as per capita number of police officers, and percent of officers assigned to drug units. The crime attributes (N=18) that could be predicted are the 8 crimes considered 'Index Crimes' by the FBI)(Murders, Rape, Robbery, .... ), per capita (actually per 100,000 population) versions of each, and Per Capita Violent Crimes and Per Capita Nonviolent Crimes). 
  
A limitation was that the LEMAS survey was of the police departments with at least 100 officers, plus a random sample of smaller departments. For our purposes, communities not found in both census and crime datasets were omitted. Many communities are missing LEMAS data.

The per capita crimes variables were calculated using population values included in the 1995 FBI data (which differ from the 1990 Census values). 

The per capita violent crimes variable was calculated using population and the sum of crime variables considered violent crimes in the United States: murder, rape, robbery, and assault. There was apparently some controversy in some states concerning the counting of rapes. These resulted in missing values for rape, which resulted in missing values for per capita violent crime. Many of these omitted communities were from the midwestern USA (Minnesota, Illinois, and Michigan have many of these).  
  
The per capita nonviolent crime variable was calculated using the sum of crime variables considered non-violent crimes in the United States: burglaries, larcenies, auto thefts and arsons. (There are many other types of crimes, these only include FBI 'Index Crimes')

Some further pre-processing of the dataset must be done. Choose the desirable dependent variable from among the 18 possible. It would not be interesting or appropriate to predict total crime (e.g. violent crime) while including subtotals (e.g. murders) as independent variables. There are also identifying variables (community name, county code, community code) that are not predictive, and would get in the way of some algorithms. Weka's Unsupervised Attribute Remove Filter can be used to remove unwanted attributes.

The FBI notes that use of this data to evaluate communities is over-simplistic, as many relevant factors are not included. For one example, communities with large numbers of visitors will have higher per capita crime (measured by residents) than communities with fewer visitors, other things being equal.

A subset of this dataset was used for the ""OPPORTUNITY Activity Recognition Challenge"" organized for the 2011 IEEE conf on Systems, Man and Cybernetics Workshop on ""Robust machine learning techniques for human activity recognition"". 

The dataset comprises the readings of motion sensors recorded while users executed typical daily activities:
  * Body-worn sensors: 7 inertial measurement units, 12 3D acceleration sensors, 4 3D localization information
  * Object sensors: 12 objects with 3D acceleration and 2D rate of turn
  * Ambient sensors: 13 switches and 8 3D acceleration sensors
  * Recordings: 4 users, 6 runs per users. Of these, 5 are Activity of Daily Living runs characterized by a natural execution of daily activities. The 6th run is a ""drill"" run, where users execute a scripted sequence of activities. 
  * Annotations/classes: the activities of the user in the scenario are annotated on different levels: ""modes of locomotion"" classes; low-level actions relating 13 actions to 23 objects; 17 mid-level gesture classes; and 5 high-level activity classes

** Recording scenario **

The activity recognition environment and scenario has been designed to generate many activity primitives, yet in a realistic manner. Subjects operated in a room simulating a studio flat with a deckchair, a kitchen, doors giving access to the outside, a coffee machine, a table and a chair.

We achieved a natural execution of activities by instructing users to follow a high-level script but leaving them free interpretation as how to achieve the high-level goals. We furthermore encouraged them to perform as naturally as possible with all the variations they were used to.

For each subject we recorded 6 different runs. Five of them, termed activity of daily living (ADL), followed a given scenario as detailed below. The remaining one, a drill run, was designed to generate a large number of activity instances. The ADL run consists of temporally unfolding situations. In each situation (e.g. preparing sandwich), a large number of action primitives occur (e.g. reach for bread, move to bread cutter, operate bread cutter).

* ADL run *

The ADL run consists of temporally unfolding situations:

    Start: lying on the deckchair, get up
    Groom: move in the room, check that all the objects are in the right places in the drawers and on shelves
    Relax: go outside and have a walk around the building
    Prepare coffee: prepare a coffee with milk and sugar using the coffee machine
    Drink coffee: take coffee sips, move around in the environment
    Prepare sandwich: include bread, cheese and salami, using the bread cutter and various knifes and plates
    Eat sandwich
    Cleanup: put objects used to original place or dish washer, cleanup the table
    Break: lie on the deckchair

* Drill run *

The drill run consists of 20 repetitions of the following sequence of activities:

    Open then close the fridge
    Open then close the dishwasher
    Open then close 3 drawers (at different heights)
    Open then close door 1
    Open then close door 2
    Toggle the lights on then off
    Clean the table
    Drink while standing
    Drink while seated

** Annotations **

The annotations are done on five ÃâtracksÃâ. One track contains modes of locomotion (e.g. sitting, standing, walking). Two other tracks indicate the actions of the left and right hand (e.g. reach, grasp, release), and to which object they apply (e.g. milk, switch, door).
The fourth track indicates the high level activities (e.g. prepare sandwich). The high level activities relate to the situations indicated in the description of the ADL runs as follows (in parenthesis the number of the situations indicated above): relaxing (1, 9), early morning (2, 3), coffee time (4, 5), sandwich time (6, 7), cleanup (8).

The mid-level gesture annotations is generated automatically from the low-level hand actions. It comprises coarser characterization of the user's activities. For instance the low-level annotations 'reach door' and 'open door' are combined into a single 'open door' mid-level annotation. Here, the mid-level annotations comprise actions of the left and right hand indiscriminately. However, in practice, the users mostly interacted with the environment with their right hand. We recommend to use the mid-level annotations in first attempts to use this dataset.

** Applications **

This dataset offers a rich playground to assess methods such as, e.g:

  * Classification, (semi-) supervised machine learning
  * Automatic segmentation
  * Unsupervised structure discovery
  * Data imputation
  * Multi-modal sensor fusion
  * Sensor network research
  * Transfer learning, multitask learning
  * Sensor selection
  * Feature extraction

Four tags for an ultra-wideband localization system are placed on the left/right front/back side of the shoulder.  

* Object sensors (60 attributes) *

12 objects are instrumented with wireless sensors measuring 3D acceleration and 2D rate of turn. This allows to detect which objects are used, and possibly also the kind of usage that is made of them.

* Ambient sensors (37 attributes) *

Ambient sensors include 13 switches and 8 3D acceleration sensors in drawers, kitchen appliances and doors.

The reed switches are placed in triplets on the fridge, dishwasher and drawer 2 and drawer 3. They may be used to detect three states of the furniture element: closed, half open, and fully open. 

The acceleration sensors may allow to assess if an element of furniture is used, and whether it may be opened or closed.",,,,,,1 citations,9409 views

Candidates must be classified in to pulsar and non-pulsar classes to aid discovery.",Multivariate,Physics and Chemistry,"Classification, Clustering",Real,17898,8,"HTRU2 is a data set which describes a sample of pulsar candidates collected during the High Time Resolution Universe Survey (South) [1]. 

Pulsars are a rare type of Neutron star that produce radio emission detectable here on Earth. They are of considerable scientific interest as probes of space-time, the inter-stellar medium, and states of matter (see [2] for more uses). 

As pulsars rotate, their emission beam sweeps across the sky, and when this crosses our line of sight, produces a detectable pattern of broadband radio emission. As pulsars
rotate rapidly, this pattern repeats periodically. Thus pulsar search involves looking for periodic radio signals with large radio telescopes.

Each pulsar produces a slightly different emission pattern, which varies slightly with each rotation (see [2] for an introduction to pulsar astrophysics to find out why). Thus a  potential signal detection known as a 'candidate', is averaged over many rotations of the pulsar, as determined by the length of an observation. In the absence of additional info, each candidate could potentially describe a real pulsar. However in practice almost all detections are caused by radio frequency interference (RFI) and noise, making legitimate signals hard to find.

Machine learning tools are now being used to automatically label pulsar candidates to facilitate rapid analysis. Classification systems in particular are being widely adopted,
(see [4,5,6,7,8,9]) which treat the candidate data sets  as binary classification problems. Here the legitimate pulsar examples are a minority positive class, and spurious examples the majority negative class. At present multi-class labels are unavailable, given the costs associated with data annotation.

The data set shared here contains 16,259 spurious examples caused by RFI/noise, and 1,639 real pulsar examples. These examples have all been checked by human annotators. 

The data is presented in two formats: CSV and ARFF (used by the WEKA data mining tool). Candidates are stored in both files in separate rows. Each row lists the variables first, and the class label is the final entry. The class labels used are 0 (negative) and 1 (positive).

Please note that the data contains no positional information or other astronomical details. It is simply feature data extracted from candidate files using the PulsarFeatureLab tool (see [10]).",No,"Fifty years of pulsar candidate selection: from simple filters to a new principled real-time classification approach

The vehicle may be viewed from one of many different angles.  

HISTORY:

This data was originally gathered at the TI in 1986-87 by JP Siebert. It was partially financed by Barr and Stroud Ltd. The original purpose was to find a method of distinguishing 3D objects within a 2D image by application of an ensemble of shape feature extractors to the 2D silhouettes of the objects. Measures of shape features extracted from example silhouettes of objects to be discriminated were used to generate a classification rule tree by means of computer induction.

This object recognition strategy was successfully used to discriminate between silhouettes of model cars, vans and buses viewed from constrained elevation but all angles of rotation.

The rule tree classification performance compared favourably to MDC (Minimum Distance Classifier) and k-NN (k-Nearest Neighbour) statistical classifiers in terms of both error rate and computational efficiency. An investigation of these rule trees generated by example indicated that the tree structure was heavily influenced by the orientation of the objects, and grouped similar object views into single decisions.


DESCRIPTION:

The features were extracted from the silhouettes by the HIPS (Hierarchical Image Processing System) extension BINATTS, which extracts a combination of scale independent features utilising both classical moments based measures such as scaled variance, skewness and kurtosis about the major/minor axes and heuristic measures such as hollows, circularity, rectangularity and compactness.

Four ""Corgie"" model vehicles were used for the experiment: a double decker bus, Cheverolet van, Saab 9000 and an Opel Manta 400. This particular combination of vehicles was chosen with the expectation that the bus, van and either one of the cars would be readily distinguishable, but it would be more difficult to distinguish between the cars.

The images were acquired by a camera looking downwards at the model vehicle from a fixed angle of elevation (34.2 degrees to the horizontal). The vehicles were placed on a diffuse backlit surface (lightbox). The vehicles were painted matte black to minimise highlights. The images were captured using a CRS4000 framestore connected to a vax 750. All images were captured with a spatial resolution of 128x128 pixels quantised to 64 greylevels. These images were thresholded to produce binary vehicle silhouettes, negated (to comply with the processing requirements of BINATTS) and thereafter subjected to shrink-expand-expand-shrink HIPS modules to remove ""salt and pepper"" image noise.

The vehicles were rotated and their angle of orientation was measured using a radial graticule beneath the vehicle. 0 and 180 degrees corresponded to ""head on"" and ""rear"" views respectively while 90 and 270 corresponded to profiles in opposite directions. Two sets of 60 images, each set covering a full 360 degree rotation, were captured for each vehicle. The vehicle was rotated by a fixed angle between images. These datasets are known as e2 and e3 respectively.

 A further two sets of images, e4 and e5, were captured with the camera at elevations of 37.5 degs and 30.8 degs respectively. These sets also contain 60 images per vehicle apart from e4.van which contains only 46 owing to the difficulty of containing the van in the image at some orientations.",No,"Vehicle Recognition Using Rule Based Methods

There are 68 categorical attributes. This data set was derived from the USCensus1990raw data set. The attributes are listed in the file USCensus1990.attributes.txt (repeated below) and the coding for the values is described below. Many of the less useful attributes in the original data set have been dropped, the few continuous variables have been discretized and the few discrete variables that have a large number of possible values have been collapsed to have fewer possible values. 

More specifically the USCensus1990 data set was obtained from the USCensus1990raw data set by the following sequence of operations; 

- Randomization: The order of the cases in the original USCensus1990raw data set were randomly permuted. 
- Selection of attributes: The 68 attributes included in the data set are given below. In the USCensus1990 data set we have added a single letter prefix to the original name. We add the letter 'i' to indicate that the original attribute values are used and 'd' to indicate that original attribute values for each case have been mapped to new values (the precise mapping is described below).

The documents were assembled and indexed with categories.,Text,Business,Classification,Categorical,21578,5,"From the original readme file (please consult it for more information):
-------------------------
The documents in the Reuters-21578 collection appeared on the Reuters newswire in 1987.  The documents were assembled and indexed with categories by personnel from Reuters Ltd. (Sam Dobbins, Mike Topliss, Steve Weinstein) and Carnegie Group, Inc. (Peggy Andersen, Monica Cellio, Phil Hayes, Laura Knecht, Irene Nirenburg) in 1987.  

In 1990, the documents were made available by Reuters and CGI for research purposes to the Information Retrieval Laboratory (W.  Bruce Croft, Director) of the Computer and Information Science Department at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst.  Formatting of the documents and production of associated data files was done in 1990 by David D.  Lewis and Stephen Harding at the Information Retrieval Laboratory.

Further formatting and data file production was done in 1991 and 1992 by David D. Lewis and Peter Shoemaker at the Center for Information and Language Studies, University of Chicago.  This version of the data was made available for anonymous FTP as ""Reuters-22173, Distribution 1.0"" in January 1993. From 1993 through 1996, Distribution 1.0 was hosted at a succession of FTP sites maintained by the Center for Intelligent Information Retrieval (W. Bruce Croft, Director) of the Computer Science Department at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst.

At the ACM SIGIR '96 conference in August, 1996 a group of text categorization researchers discussed how published results on Reuters-22173 could be made more comparable across studies.  It was decided that a new version of collection should be produced with less ambiguous formatting, and including documentation carefully spelling out standard methods of using the collection.  The opportunity would also be used to correct a variety of typographical and other errors in the categorization and formatting of the collection.

Steve Finch and David D. Lewis did this cleanup of the collection September through November of 1996, relying heavily on Finch's SGML-tagged version of the collection from an earlier study.  One result of the re-examination of the collection was the removal of 595 documents which were exact duplicates (based on identity of timestamps down to the second) of other documents in the collection. The new collection therefore has only 21,578 documents, and thus is called the Reuters-21578 collection.  This README describes version 1.0 of this new collection, which we refer to as ""Reuters-21578, Distribution 1.0"".

In preparing the collection and documentation we have benefited from discussions with Eric Brown, William Cohen, Fred Damerau, Yoram Singer, Amit Singhal, and Yiming Yang, among many others.

In particular, two distinct types of features were considered in the creation of this dataset: (i) the so-called steady-state feature (DR), defined as the maximal resistance change with respect to the baseline and its DR normalized version (DR divided by the acquired value when the chemical vapor is present in the test chamber). And (ii), an aggregate of features reflecting the sensor dynamics of the increasing/decaying transient portion of the sensor response during the entire measurement. This aggregate of features is a transformation, borrowed from the field of econometrics and originally introduced to the chemo-sensing community by Muezzinoglu et al. (2009), that converts the transient portion of the sensor response into a real scalar by estimating the maximum/minimum value y[k] for the rising/decaying portion of the exponential moving average of the sensor response:

y[k] = (1-Alfa) y[k-1]+Alfa(R[k]-R[k-1])

where R[k] is the sensor resistance measured at time k and Alfa is a scalar smoothing parameter between 0 and 1.

In particular, three different values for Alfa=0.1, 0.01, 0.001 were set to obtain three different feature values from the rising portion of the sensor response and three additional features with the same Alfa values for the decaying portion of the sensor response, covering thus the entire sensor response dynamics. 

Thus, each feature vector contains the 8 features extracted from each particular sensor, resulting in a 128-dimensional feature vector (8 features x 16 sensors) containing all the features and organized as follows:
DR_1, |DR|_1, EMAi0.001_1, EMAi0.01_1, EMAi0.1_1, EMAd0.001_1, EMAd0.01_1, EMAd0.1_1, DR_2, |DR|_2, EMAi0.001_2, EMAi0.01_2, EMAi0.1_2, EMAd0.001_2, EMAd0.01_2, EMAd0.1_2,..., DR_16, |DR|_16, EMAi0.001_16, EMAi0.01_16, EMAi0.1_16, EMAd0.001_16, EMAd0.01_16, EMAd0.1_16
where: DR_j and |DR|_j are the R and the normalized R features, respectively. EMAi0.001_j, EMAi0.01_j, and EMAi0.1_j, are the emaR of the rising transient portion of the sensor response for Alfa 0.001, 0.01, and 0.1, respectively. EMAd0.001_j, EMAd0.01_j, and EMAd0.1_j, are emaR of the decaying transient portion of the sensor response for Alfa 0.001, 0.01, and 0.1, respectively. The index j=1Ã¢â¬Â¦16 represents the number of the sensor, forming thus the 128-dimensional feature vector. 

For processing purposes, the dataset is organized into ten batches, each containing the number of measurements per class and month indicated in the tables below. This reorganization of data was done to ensure having a sufficient and as uniformly distributed as possible number of experiments in each batch. 

Batch ID Month IDs

The dataset is organized in files, each representing a different batch. Within the files, each line represents a measurement. The first character (1-6) codes the analyte, followed by the concentration level:

1: Ethanol; 2: Ethylene; 3: Ammonia; 4: Acetaldehyde; 5: Acetone; 6: Toluene

The data format follows the same coding style as in libsvm format x:v, where x stands for the feature number and v for the actual value of the feature. For example, in

There are eight types of physical therapy exercises, each of which has three execution types (correct, fast, and low-amplitude). Each execution type of each type of exercise was performed multiple times by five subjects. The subjects wore five MTx sensor units manufactured by XSens. Each unit contains three tri-axial sensors: an accelerometer, a gyroscope, and a magnetometer, sampled at 25 Hz.",Time-Series,Engineering,"Classification, Clustering, Other",-,268881,-,The dataset was created within a study on automated detection of the executions of physical therapy exercises using wearable motion sensors. The exercises and the experimental procedure are determined in collaboration with a physical therapy specialist.,"The dataset contains time series data recorded during training sessions (with time indices of the selected templates) and simulated exercise sessions (with multiple exercise executions). The sessions exhibit pre-determined patterns, which are explained in the Description.pdf document.","Automated evaluation of physical therapy exercises using multi-template dynamic time warping on wearable sensor signals

It is collected from 51 test subjects as they perform 18 activities for 3 minutes apiece. The sensor data for each device (phone, watch) and type of sensor (accelerometer, gyroscope) is stored in a different directory (so there are 4 data directories). In each directory there are 51 files corresponding to the 51 test subjects. The format of every entry is the same: <subject-id, activity-code, timestamp, x, y, z>. The descriptions of these attributes are provided with the attribute information. In addition to the raw time-series sensor data we also generate examples that describe the sensor data using a 10-second window. See the dataset description document for details. Although this data can most naturally be used for activity recognition, it can also be used to build behavioral biometric models since each sensor reading is associated with a specific subject.",No,"subject-id: value from 1600- 1650 that identifies one of the 51 test subjects

5. mfeat-zer: 47 Zernike moments; 
6. mfeat-mor: 6 morphological features. 

In each file the 2000 patterns are stored in ASCI on 2000 lines. The first 200 patterns are of class `0', followed by sets of 200 patterns for each of the classes `1' - `9'. Corresponding patterns in different feature sets (files) correspond to the same original character.

54,2024-10-28 16:11:32,ISOLET,9/11/1994,Goal: Predict which letter-name was spoken--a simple classification task.,Multivariate,Computer Science,Classification,Real,7797,617,"This data set was generated as follows. 150 subjects spoke the name of each letter of the alphabet twice. Hence, we have 52 training examples from each speaker. The speakers are grouped into sets of 30 speakers each, and are referred to as isolet1, isolet2, isolet3, isolet4, and isolet5. The data appears in isolet1+2+3+4.data in sequential order, first the speakers from isolet1, then isolet2, and so on.  The test set, isolet5, is a separate file.

You will note that 3 examples are missing.  I believe they were dropped due to difficulties in recording.

I believe this is a good domain for a noisy, perceptual task.  It is also a very good domain for testing the scaling abilities of algorithms. For example, C4.5 on this domain is slower than backpropagation!

310,2024-10-28 16:12:26,UJIIndoorLoc,9/17/2014,The UJIIndoorLoc is a Multi-Building Multi-Floor indoor localization database to test Indoor Positioning System that rely on WLAN/WiFi fingerprint.,Multivariate,Computer Science,"Classification, Regression","Integer, Real",21048,-,"Many real world applications need to know the localization of a user in the world to provide their services. Therefore, automatic user localization has been a hot research topic in the last years. Automatic user localization consists of estimating the position of the user (latitude, longitude and altitude) by using an electronic device, usually a mobile phone. Outdoor localization problem can be solved very accurately thanks to the inclusion of GPS sensors into the mobile devices. However, indoor localization is still an open problem mainly due to the loss of GPS signal in indoor environments. Although, there are some indoor positioning technologies and methodologies, this database is focused on WLAN fingerprint-based ones (also know as WiFi Fingerprinting).

Although there are many papers in the literature trying to solve the indoor localization problem using a WLAN fingerprint-based method, there still exists one important drawback in this field which is the lack of a common database for comparison purposes. So, UJIIndoorLoc database is presented to overcome this gap. We expect that the proposed database will become the reference database to compare different indoor localization methodologies based on WiFi fingerprinting.

The UJIIndoorLoc database covers three buildings of Universitat Jaume I with 4 or more floors and almost 110.000m2. It can be used for classification, e.g. actual building and floor identification, or regression, e.g. actual longitude and latitude estimation. It was created in 2013 by means of more than 20 different users and 25 Android devices. The database consists of 19937 training/reference records (trainingData.csv file) and 1111 validation/test records (validationData.csv file).

The 529 attributes contain the WiFi fingerprint, the coordinates where it was taken, and other useful information.

Each WiFi fingerprint can be characterized by the detected Wireless Access Points (WAPs) and the corresponding Received Signal Strength Intensity (RSSI). The intensity values are represented as negative integer values ranging -104dBm (extremely poor signal) to 0dbM. The positive value 100 is used to denote when a WAP was not detected. During the database creation, 520 different WAPs were detected. Thus, the WiFi fingerprint is composed by 520 intensity values.

Then the coordinates (latitude, longitude, floor) and Building ID are provided as the attributes to be predicted. 

Additional information has been provided.

The particular space (offices, labs, etc.) and the relative position (inside/outside the space) where the capture was taken have been recorded. Outside means that the capture was taken in front of the door of the space.

Information about who (user), how (android device & version) and when (timestamp) WiFi capture was taken is also recorded.",No,"Variable Name Role Type Description Units Missing Values

The different blocks forming the complete simulator (Propeller, Hull, GT, Gear Box and Controller) have been developed and fine tuned over the year on several similar real propulsion plants. In view of these observations the available data are in agreement with a possible real vessel.
In this release of the simulator it is also possible to take into account the performance decay over time of the GT components such as GT compressor and turbines.
The propulsion system behaviour has been described with this parameters:
- Ship speed (linear function of the lever position lp).
- Compressor degradation coefficient kMc.
- Turbine degradation coefficient kMt.
so that each possible degradation state can be described by a combination of this triple (lp,kMt,kMc).
The range of decay of compressor and turbine has been sampled with an uniform grid of precision 0.001 so to have a good granularity of representation.
In particular for the compressor decay state discretization the kMc coefficient has been investigated in the domain [1; 0.95], and the turbine coefficient in the domain [1; 0.975].
Ship speed has been investigated sampling the range of feasible speed from 3 knots to 27 knots with a granularity of representation equal to tree knots.
A series of measures (16 features) which indirectly represents of the state of the system subject to performance decay has been acquired and stored in the dataset over the parameter's space.

1. Primary o-ring erosion and/or blowby
2. Primary o-ring erosion only

The two databases are identical except for the 2nd attribute of the 21st instance (confirmed by David Draper on 8/5/93).

Edited from (Draper, 1993):

The motivation for collecting this database was the explosion of the USA Space Shuttle Challenger on 28 January, 1986.  An investigation ensued into the reliability of the shuttle's propulsion system.  The explosion was eventually traced to the failure of one of the three field joints on one of the two solid booster rockets.  Each of these six field joints includes two O-rings, designated as primary and secondary, which fail when phenomena called erosion and blowby both occur. 

The night before the launch a decision had to be made regarding launch safety.  The discussion among engineers and managers leading to this decision included concern that the probability of failure of the O-rings depended on the temperature t at launch, which was forecase to be 31 degrees F. There are strong engineering reasons based on the composition of O-rings to support the judgment that failure probability may rise monotonically as temperature drops.  One other variable, the pressure s at which safety testing for field join leaks was performed, was available, but its relevance to the failure process was unclear.
       
Draper's paper includes a menacing figure graphing the number of field joints experiencing stress vs. liftoff temperature for the 23 shuttle flights previous to the Challenger disaster.  No previous liftoff temperature was under 53 degrees F.  Although tremendous extrapolation must be done from the given data to assess risk at 31 degrees F, it is obvious even to the layman ""to foresee the unacceptably high risk created by launching at 31 degrees F.""  For more information, see Draper (1993) or the other previous analyses.
       
The task is to predict the number of O-rings that will experience thermal distress for a given flight when the launch temperature is below freezing.",No,"Variable Name Role Type Description Units Missing Values

395,2024-10-28 16:15:33,Parkinson Disease Spiral Drawings Using Digitized Graphics Tablet,7/19/2017,"Handwriting database consists of 62 PWP(People with Parkinson) and 15 healthy individuals. Three types of recordings (Static Spiral Test, Dynamic Spiral Test and Stability Test) are taken.",Multivariate,Computer Science,"Classification, Regression, Clustering",Integer,77,-,"The PD and control handwriting database consists of 62 PWP (People with parkinson) and 15 healthy individuals who appealed at the Department of Neurology in Cerrahpasa Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul University. From all subjects, three types of handwriting recordings (Static Spiral Test (SST), Dynamic Spiral Test (DST) and Stability Test on Certain Point (STCP)) are taken. Also the drawings of spirals belongs to the PWP are included in the dataset as image. Therefore, this dataset can also be used for regression. 

Handwriting dataset was constructed using Wacom Cintiq 12WX graphics (Hahne et al., 2009) table. It is basically a graphics tablet and LCD monitor rolled into one. It enables to display a PC's screen on its monitor and only interacts with digitized pens. Special software was designed for recording handwriting drawings and testing the coordination of the PD patients using the recordings. The software uses API functions of the device and was developed in C# platform which can be run on Windows systems You can contact with the authors to request the software which is mentioned [1]. 

In this study, there are three different kinds of tests developed for the data collection via graphics tablet. The first one isthe Static Spiral Test (SST) which is frequently used for clinical research in the literature for different purposes like determining motor performance (Wang et al., 2008), measuring tremor (Pullman, 1998) and diagnosing PD (Saunders et al., 2008). In this test, three wound Archimedean spirals appears on the graphics tablet using the software and patients were asked to retrace the same spiral as much as they can using the digital pen. During the test, the features which are mentioned above and the other data to specify the patient are recorded to the database. 

The second test is the Dynamic Spiral Test (DST). Unlike SST, Archimedean spiral just appears and disappears in certain time intervals, in other words the Archimedean spiral blinks. This forces the patient to keep the pattern in mind and continue to draw. The purpose of this test is to determine the change in patient's drawing performance and pause times since it is more difficult to retrace the Archimedean spiral in this case. As a result of this test, it is observed that most of the patients continued drawing but nearly all of them lost the pattern. 

The third test is Stability Test on Certain Point (STCP). In this test, there is a certain red point in the middle of the screen and the subjects are asked to hold the digital pen on the point without touching the screen in a certain time. The purpose of this test is to determine the patient's hand stability or hand tremor level.

They performed a protocol of activities composed of six basic activities: three static postures (standing, sitting, lying) and three dynamic activities (walking, walking downstairs and walking upstairs). The experiment also included postural transitions that occurred between the static postures. These are: stand-to-sit, sit-to-stand, sit-to-lie, lie-to-sit, stand-to-lie, and lie-to-stand. All the participants were wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist during the experiment execution. We captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz using the embedded accelerometer and gyroscope of the device. The experiments were video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset was randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of 561 features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

This dataset is an updated version of the UCI Human Activity Recognition Using smartphones Dataset that can be found at: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
This version provides the original raw inertial signals from the smartphone sensors, instead of the ones pre-processed into windows which were provided in version 1. This change was done in order to be able to make online tests with the raw data. Moreover, the activity labels were updated in order to include postural transitions that were not part of the previous version of the dataset.

will perform the presumptive diagnosis of two diseases of urinary system. It will be 
the example of diagnosing of the acute inflammations of urinary bladder and acute 
nephritises. For better understanding of the problem let us consider definitions of 
both diseases given by medics. Acute inflammation of urinary bladder is characterised 
by sudden occurrence of pains in the abdomen region and the urination in form of 
constant urine pushing, micturition pains and sometimes lack of urine keeping. 
Temperature of the body is rising, however most often not above 38C. The excreted 
urine is turbid and sometimes bloody. At proper treatment, symptoms decay usually 
within several days. However, there is inclination to returns. At persons with acute 
inflammation of urinary bladder, we should expect that the illness will turn into 
protracted form.

Acute nephritis of renal pelvis origin occurs considerably more often at women than at 
men. It begins with sudden fever, which reaches, and sometimes exceeds 40C. The fever 
is accompanied by shivers and one- or both-side lumbar pains, which are sometimes very 
strong. Symptoms of acute inflammation of urinary bladder appear very often. Quite not 
infrequently there are nausea and vomiting and spread pains of whole abdomen.

The data was created by a medical expert as a data set to test the expert system, which 
will perform the presumptive diagnosis of two diseases of urinary system.  The basis for 
rules detection was Rough Sets Theory.  Each instance represents an potential patient.

The data is in an ASCII file. Attributes are separated by TAB.
Each line of the data file starts with a digit which tells the temperature of patient.

Using a time interval of 24 hours, we extracted daily transactions on the network and formed the Bitcoin graph. We filtered out the network edges that transfer less than B0.3, since ransom amounts are rarely below this threshold.

length: Integer.

income: Integer. Satoshi amount (1 bitcoin = 100 million satoshis).
label: Category String. Name of the ransomware family (e.g., Cryptxxx, cryptolocker etc) or white (i.e., not known to be ransomware).

Our graph features are designed to quantify specific transaction patterns. Loop is intended to count how many transaction i) split their coins; ii) move these coins in the network by using different paths and finally, and iii) merge them in a single address. Coins at this final address can then be sold and converted to fiat currency. Weight quantifies the merge behavior (i.e., the transaction has more input addresses than output addresses), where coins in multiple addresses are each passed through a succession of merging transactions and accumulated in a final address. Similar to weight, the count feature is designed to quantify the merging pattern. However, the count feature represents information on the number of transactions, whereas the weight feature represents information on the amount (what percent of these transactionsÃ¢â¬â¢ output?) of transactions. Length is designed to quantify mixing rounds on Bitcoin, where transactions receive and distribute similar amounts of coins in multiple rounds with newly created addresses to hide the coin origin.

White Bitcoin addresses are capped at 1K per day (Bitcoin has 800K addresses daily).

For each mixture, signals were acquired continuously during 12 hours.","Multivariate, Time-Series",Computer Science,"Classification, Regression",Real,4178504,19,"This data set contains the acquired time series from 16 chemical sensors exposed to gas mixtures at varying concentration levels. In particular, we generated two gas mixtures: Ethylene and Methane in air, and Ethylene and CO in air. Each measurement was constructed by the continuous acquisition of the 16-sensor array signals for a duration of about 12 hours without interruption. 

The data set was collected in a gas delivery platform facility at the ChemoSignals Laboratory in the BioCircuits Institute, University of California San Diego. The measurement system platform provides versatility for obtaining the desired concentrations of the chemical substances of interest with high accuracy and in a highly reproducible manner. 

The sensor array included 16 chemical sensors (Figaro Inc., US) of 4 different types: TGS-2600, TGS-2602, TGS-2610, TGS-2620 (4 units of each type). The sensors were integrated with customized signal conditioning and control electronics. The operating voltage of the sensors, which controls the sensorsÃ¢â¬â¢ operating temperature, was kept constant at 5 V for the whole duration of the experiments. The sensorsÃ¢â¬â¢ conductivities were acquired continuously at a sampling frequency of 100 Hz. The sensor array was placed in a 60 ml measurement chamber, where the gas sample was injected at a constant flow of 300 ml/min.

Each measurement was constructed by the continuous acquisition of the 16-sensor array signals while concentration levels changed randomly. For each measurement (each gas mixture), the signals were acquired continuously for about 12 hours without interruption. 

The concentration transitions were set at random times (in the interval 80-120s) and to random concentration levels. The data set was constructed such that all possible transitions are present: increasing, decreasing, or setting to zero the concentration of one volatile while the concentration of the other volatile is kept constant (either at a fixed or at zero concentration level). At the beginning, ending, and approximately every 10,000 s, we inserted additional predefined concentration patterns with pure gas mixtures.

The concentration ranges for Ethylene, Methane, and CO were selected such that the induced magnitudes of the sensor responses were similar. Moreover, for gas mixtures, lower concentration levels were favored. Therefore, the multivariate response of the sensors to the presented set of stimuli is challenging since none of the configurations (single
gas or mixture presentation) can be easily identified from the magnitude of sensorsÃ¢â¬â¢ responses. In particular Ethylene concentration ranges from 0-20 ppm; 0-600 ppm for CO; and 0-300 ppm for Methane.

The primary purpose of making this data set freely accessible on-line is to provide extensive and continuous time series acquired from chemical sensors to the sensor and artificial intelligence research communities to develop and test strategies to solve a wide variety of tasks. In particular, the data set may be useful to develop algorithms for continuous monitoring or improve response time of sensory systems. Also, the repetition of the same type of sensors in the array will allow further investigation on sensor variability (reproducibility of sensors of the same kind). Other interesting topics may include sensor failure (to what extent system predictions degrade when sensors start failing) or calibration transfer (whether the model for one sensor can be extended to other sensors).

More information on the generated data set can be found in Fonollosa et al. 'Reservoir Computing compensates slow response of chemosensor arrays exposed to fast varying gas concentrations in continuous monitoring'; Sensors and Actuators B, 2015. 

The data set can be used exclusively for research purposes. Commercial purposes are fully excluded. ",No,"The data is presented in two different files: Each file contains the data from one mixture. The file ethylene_CO.txt contains the recordings from the sensors when exposed to mixtures of Ethylene and CO in air. The file ethylene_methane.txt contains the acquired time series induced by the mixture of Methane and Ethylene in air.

The structure of the files is the same: Data is distributed in 19 columns. First column represents time (in seconds), second column represents Methane (or CO) concentration set point (in ppm), third column details Ethylene concentration set point (in ppm), and the following 16 columns show the recordings of the sensor array. 

Files include a header (one line) with the information of each column:

Time (seconds), Methane conc (ppm), Ethylene conc (ppm), sensor readings (16 channels)

The order of the sensors in the files is as follows:
TGS2602; TGS2602; TGS2600; TGS2600; TGS2610; TGS2610; TGS2620; TGS2620; TGS2602; TGS2602; TGS2600; TGS2600; TGS2610; TGS2610; TGS2620; TGS2620

A cooler fan with weights on its blades was used to generate vibrations. To this fan cooler was attached an accelerometer to collect the vibration data. With this data, motor failure time predictions were made, using an artificial neural networks. To generate three distinct vibration scenarios, the weights were distributed in three different ways: 1) 'red' - normal configuration: two weight pieces positioned on neighboring blades; 2) 'blue' - perpendicular configuration: two weight pieces positioned on blades forming a 90ÃÂ° angle; 3) 'green' - opposite configuration: two weight pieces positioned on opposite blades. A schematic diagram can be seen in figure 3 of the paper.

Devices used:
Akasa AK-FN059 12cm Viper cooling fan (Generate the vibrations)
MMA8452Q accelerometer (Measure vibration)

Data collection method:
17 rotation speeds were set up, ranging from 20% to 100% of the cooler maximum speed at 5% intervals; for the three weight distribution configurations in the cooler blades. Note that the Akasa AK-FN059 cooler has 1900 rpm of max rotation speed.

122,2024-10-28 16:16:46,El Nino,6/29/1999,The data set contains oceanographic and surface meteorological readings taken from a series of buoys positioned throughout the equatorial Pacific.,Other,Climate and Environment,Other,"Integer, Real",178080,11,"This data was collected with the Tropical Atmosphere Ocean (TAO) array which was developed by the international Tropical Ocean Global Atmosphere (TOGA) program. The TAO array consists of nearly 70 moored buoys spanning the equatorial Pacific, measuring oceanographic and surface meteorological variables critical for improved detection, understanding and prediction of seasonal-to-interannual climate variations originating in the tropics, most notably those related to the El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycles. 

The moorings were developed by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory (PMEL). Each mooring measures air temperature, relative humidity, surface winds, sea surface temperatures and subsurface temperatures down to a depth of 500 meters and a few a of the buoys measure currents, rainfall and solar radiation. The data from the array, and current updates, can be viewed on the web at the this address . 

The El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycle of 1982-1983, the strongest of the century, created many problems throughout the world. Parts of the world such as Peru and the Unites States experienced destructive flooding from increased rainfalls while the western Pacific areas experienced drought and devastating brush fires. The ENSO cycle was neither predicted nor detected until it was near its peak. This highlighted the need for an ocean observing system (i.e. the TAO array) to support studies of large scale ocean-atmosphere interactions on seasonal-to-interannual time scales. 

The TAO array provides real-time data to climate researchers, weather prediction centers and scientists around the world. Forcasts for tropical Pacific Ocean temperatures for one to two years in advance can be made using the ENSO cycle data. These forcasts are possible because of the moored buoys, along with drifting buoys, volunteer ship temperature probes, and sea level measurements. 

Research questions of interest include: 

- How can the data be used to predict weather conditions throughout the world? 
- How do the variables relate to each other? 
- Which variables have a greater effect on the climate variations? 
- Does the amount of movement of the buoy effect the reliability of the data? 
- When performing an analysis of the data, one should pay attention the possible affect of autocorrelation. Using a multiple regression approach to model the data would require a look at autoregression since the weather statistics of the previous days will affect today's weather. 

The data is stored in an ASCII files with one observation per line. Spaces separate fields and periods (.) denote missing values.

Only a subset of 3 are used during testing (the latter 3).  Furthermore, only 2 of the 3 concepts are ""used"" during testing (i.e., those with the prototypes 000 and 111).  I've mapped all values to their zero-indexing equivalents.

Some instances could be placed in either category 0 or 1.  I've followed the authors' suggestion, placing them in each category with equal probability.

I've replaced the actual values of the attributes (i.e., hobby has values chess, sports and stamps) with numeric values.  I think this is how the authors' did this when testing the categorization models described in the paper.  I find this unfair.  While the subjects were able to bring background knowledge to bear on the attribute values and their relationships, the algorithms were provided with no such knowledge.  I'm uncertain whether the 2 distractor attributes (name and hobby) are presented to the authors' algorithms during testing.  However, it is clear that only the age, educational status, and marital status attributes are given during the human subjects' transfer tests.

328,2024-10-28 16:19:12,Greenhouse Gas Observing Network,4/15/2015,Design an observing network to monitor emissions of a greenhouse gas (GHG) in California given time series of synthetic observations and tracers from weather model simulations.,"Multivariate, Time-Series",Climate and Environment,Regression,Real,2921,5232,"This data set contains time series of greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations at 2921 grid cells in California created using simulations of the Weather Research and Forecast model with Chemistry (WRF-Chem). Each grid cell covers an area of 12 km by 12 km, and there is one data file per grid cell. Each file contains 16 time series of GHG concentrations. The data points in the time series are spaced 6 hours apart (4 samples per day) over the period May 10 Ã¢â¬â July 31, 2010. The first 15 rows are time series of GHG tracers released from 14 distinct spatial regions in California and one outside of California. The last row corresponds to the time series of Ã¢â¬Åsynthetic GHG observationsÃ¢â¬Â generated with EDGAR emissions of HFC-134a scaled by a factor 0.7 and with noise added.

Using this data, the goals are to (1) use inverse methods to determine the optimal values of the weights in the weighted sum of 15 tracers that best matches the synthetic observations, (2) and use optimization methods to determine the best locations to observe GHGs to constrain the inversion. We used a Bayesian method for (1) and genetic algorithms for (2). 

Further details about the data and methods are given in the publication 'Designing optimal greenhouse gas observing networks that consider performance and cost,' Geoscientific Instrumentation Methods and Data Systems.",No,"Each file in the data set is labeled ghg.gid.siteWXYZ.dat, where WXYZ is an integer location ID described in our manuscript.

At each location,
        Rows 1-15: GHG concentrations of tracers emitted from regions 1-15
        Row 16: GHG concentrations of synthetic observations
        Columns 1-327: GHG concentrations every 6 hours from May 10 Ã¢â¬â July 31, 2010.

Van de Welde, W. Wenzel, J. Wnek, and J. Zhang has been published as Technical Report CS-CMU-91-197, Carnegie Mellon University in Dec. 1991.

One significant characteristic of this comparison is that it was performed by a collection of researchers, each of whom was an advocate of the technique they tested (often they were the creators of the various methods). In this sense, the results are less biased than in comparisons performed by a single person advocating a specific learning method, and more accurately reflect the generalization behavior of the learning techniques as applied by knowledgeable users.

There are three MONK's problems.  The domains for all MONK's problems are the same (described below).  One of the MONK's problems has noise added. For each problem, the domain has been partitioned into a train and test set.",No,"The MONK''s Problems-A Performance Comparison of Different Learning Algorithms, CMU-CS-91-197, Sch

ABSTRACT='The leading treads towards social networking services had drawn massive
public attention from last one and half decade. The amount of data that is
uploaded to these social networking services is increasing day by day. So,
there is massive requirement to study the highly dynamic behavior of users
towards these services. This is a preliminary work to model the user
patterns and to study the effectiveness of machine learning predictive
modeling approaches on leading social networking service Facebook. We
modeled the user comment patters, over the posts on Facebook Pages and
predicted that how many comments a post is expected to receive in next H
hrs. In order to automate the process, we developed a software prototype
consisting of the crawler, Information extractor, information processor and
knowledge discovery module. We used Neural Networks and Decision Trees,
predictive modeling techniques on different dataset variants and evaluated
them under Hits(at)10 (custom measure), Area Under Curve, Evaluation Time
and Mean Absolute error evaluation metrics. We concluded that the Decision
trees performed better than the Neural Networks under light of all
evaluation metrics.'

487,2024-10-28 16:20:03,Gas sensor array temperature modulation,4/14/2019,A chemical detection platform composed of 14 temperature-modulated metal oxide (MOX) gas sensors was exposed during 3 weeks to mixtures of carbon monoxide and humid synthetic air in a gas chamber.,"Multivariate, Time-Series",Computer Science,"Classification, Regression",Real,4095000,-,"A chemical detection platform composed of 14 temperature-modulated metal oxide semiconductor (MOX) gas sensors was exposed to dynamic mixtures of carbon monoxide (CO) and humid synthetic air in a gas chamber. 

The acquired time series of the sensors and the measured values of CO concentration, humidity and temperature inside the gas chamber are provided. 

a) Chemical detection platform: 
The chemical detection platform was composed of 14 MOX gas sensors that generate a time-dependent multivariate response to the different gas stimuli. 
The utilized sensors were made commercially available by Figaro Engineering (7 units of TGS 3870-A04) and FIS (7 units of SB-500-12).
The operating temperature of the sensors was controlled by the built-in heater, which voltage was modulated in the range 0.2-0.9 V in cycles of 20 and 25 s, following the manufacturer recommendations (0.9 V for 5s, 0.2 V for 20s, 0.9 V for 5 s, 0.2 V for 25 s, ...). 
The sensors were pre-heated for one week before starting the experiments.
The MOX read-out circuits consisted of voltage dividers with 1 MOhm load resistors and powered at 5V.
The output voltage of the sensors was sampled at 3.5 Hz using an Agilent HP34970A/34901A DAQ configured at 15 bits of precision and input impedance greater than 10 GOhm.

b) Generator of dynamic gas mixtures
Dynamic mixtures of CO and humid synthetic air were delivered from high purity gases in cylinders to a small-sized polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) test chamber (250 cm3 internal volume), by means of a piping system and mass flow controllers (MFCs).
Gas mixing was performed using mass flow controllers (MFC),which controlled three different gas streams (CO, wet air and dry air). These streams were delivered from high quality pressurized
gases in cylinders. 
The selected MFCs (EL-FLOW Select, Bronkhorst) had full scale flow rates of 1000 mln/min for the dry and wet air streams and 3 mln/min for the CO channel. 
The CO bottle contained 1600 ppm of CO diluted in synthetic air with 21 ÃÂ± 1% O2. 
The relative uncertainty in the generated CO concentration was below 5.5%.
The wet and dry air streams were both delivered from a synthetic air bottle with 99.995% purity and 21 ÃÂ± 1% O2. 
Humidification of the wet stream was based on the saturation method using a glass bubbler (Drechsler bottles). 

c)  Temperature/humidity values
A temperature/humidity sensor (SHT75, from Sensirion) provided reference humidity and temperature values inside the test chamber with tolerance below 1.8% r.h. and 0.5 ÃÂºC, respectively, every 5 s.
The temperature variations inside the gas chamber, for each experiment, were below 3 ÃÂºC. 

d) Experimental protocol: 
Each experiment consisted on 100 measurements: 10 experimental concentrations uniformly distributed in the range 0-20 ppm and 10 replicates per concentration. 
Each replicate had a relative humidity randomly chosen from a uniform distribution between 15% and 75% r.h. 
At the beginning of each experiment, the gas chamber was cleaned for 15 min using a stream of synthetic air at a flow rate of 240 mln/min. 
After that, the gas mixtures were released in random order at a constant flow rate of 240 mln/min for 15 min each. 
A single experiment lasted 25 hours (100 samples x 15 minutes/sample) and was replicated on 13 working days spanning a natural period of 17 days.",No,"Variable Name Role Type Description Units Missing Values

123,2024-10-28 16:20:43,Entree Chicago Recommendation Data,3/8/2000,This data contains a record of user interactions with the Entree Chicago restaurant recommendation system.,"Transactional, Sequential",Other,Recommender-Systems,Categorical,50672,-,"This data records interactions with Entree Chicago restaurant recommendation system (originally http://infolab.cs.uchicago.edu/entree) from September, 1996 to April, 1999. The data is organized into files roughly spanning a quarter year -- with Q3 1996 and Q2 1999 each only containing one month. 

Each line in a session file represents a session of user interaction with the system. The (tab-separated) fields are as follows: 

     Date, IP, Entry point, Rated restaurant1, ..., Rated restaurantN, End point

1. Entry point:

Users can use a restaurant from any city as a entry point, but they always get recommendations for Chicago restaurants. The entry point therefore draws from a larger universe of restaurants than the rest of the data. 
Entry points have the form nnnX, where nnn is a numeric restaurant ID and X is a character A-H that encodes the city. 

     A = Atlanta
     B = Boston
     C = Chicago
     D = Los Angeles
     E = New Orleans
     F = New York
     G = San Francisco
     H = Washington DC

2. Rated Restaurant:

These are all Chicago restaurants. 
These entries have the form nnnX, where nnn is a numeric restaurant ID and X is a character L-T that encodes the navigation operation. 

     L = browse (move from one restaurant in a list of recommendations to another)
     M = cheaper (search for a restaurant like this one, but cheaper)
     N = nicer   (         ""               ""           , but nicer)
     O = closer  (unused in the production version of the system)
     P = more traditional (search for a restaurant like this, but serving more traditional cuisine)
     Q = more creative (search for a restaurant serving more creative cuisine)
     R = more lively (search for a restaurant with a livelier atmosphere)
     S = quieter (search for a restaurant with a quieter atmosphere)
     T = change cuisine (search for a restaurant like this, but serving a different kind of food) Note that with this tweak, we would ideally like to know what cuisine the user wanted to change to, but this information was not recorded.

3. End point:

Just the numeric id for the (Chicago) restaurant that the user saw last. In our experiments, we are assuming that this was a good suggestion, but it is also possible that user just gives up. 
Some potentially useful data is missing. In many cases, we don't know the starting point because the user input a set of selection criteria (such as ""inexpensive traditional Mexican"") using a form submission, rather than starting from a known restaurant. These queries were not recorded. This is denoted by a 0 in the entry point field. Some sessions do not have a known end point. This is marked by -1 in the end point field. 


In addition to the user's interactions, there is also data linking the restaurant ID with its name and features such as ""fabulous wine lists"", ""good for younger kids"", and ""Ethopian"" cuisine. This data is stored by city (e.g. Atlanta, Boston, etc.) and is in the following format:

506,2024-10-28 16:20:47,Human Activity Recognition from Continuous Ambient Sensor Data,9/19/2019,This dataset represents ambient data collected in homes with volunteer residents. Data are collected continuously while residents perform their normal routines.,"Multivariate, Sequential, Time-Series",Other,Classification,"Integer, Real",13956534,-,"4. Relevant Information
    -- Data Set Characteristics: Multivariate, Sequential, Time-Series
    -- This dataset represents ambient data collected in homes with volunteer residents.
       Data are collected continuously while residents perform their normal routines.
       Ambient PIR motion sensors, door/temperature sensors, and light switch sensors
       are placed throughout the home of the volunteer.  The sensors are placed in locations
       throughout the home that are related to specific activites of daily living that we
       wish to capture.
    -- The classification task is to predict the activity that is occurring in the smart
       home and being observed by the ambient sensors.  The sensors communicate using the
       ZigBee Pro protocol, forming a mesh network with all battery powered sensors as leaf
       nodes and always-on devices (light switches and ZigBee relays) forming the branches
       that connect back to the USB gateway on our local SHiB [2] server.
    -- The original format captured from the sensors is provided, as well as the feature
       vector we generate using a sliding window of 30 sensor events.  Each annotated data
       file (ex: csh101/csh101.ann.txt) has a corresponding feature vector CSV file
       (ex: csh101/csh101.ann.features.csv).  Most of the sensor data files contain labels
       for two months of the collection period, though some contain labels for extended
       time periods.
    -- We have also included the entire dataset collected at each smart home in the original
       format (ex: csh101/csh101.rawdata.txt) and the generated feature vector CSV file
       (ex: csh101/csh101.rawdata.features.csv).
    -- An analysis of the attributes for each features CSV file is found in the corresponding
       readme (ex: csh101/csh101.ann.features.csv is described by
       csh101/csh101.ann.features.README.txt).
    -- The smart home layout, and sensor placement from the original formats is found
       in the included sensor map for each smart home (ex: csh101/csh101.sensor_map.png).
    -- The original format is:
       <Date> <Time> <Sensor> <Translate01> <Translate02> <Message> <SensorType> <Activity>
        -- <Date> is YYYY-MM-DD, in local time.
        -- <Time> is HH:MM:SS.ms, 24-hour and in local time.
        -- <Sensor> is the name of the sensor, this can be found on the sensor map.
        -- <Translate01> is the room-level sensor location.
        -- <Translate02> is more detailed, usually identifying what in the room the sensor
           is aimed at or sensing.
        -- <Message> is the message generated by the sensor (we define these in more detail
           below).
        -- <SensorType> is the type of sensor generating the event, so you know what to
           expect for a message.  In these earlier smart homes many of the sensors could
           be identified by their name, but in later configurations you had to use this
           field to identify what sensor was sending the message.
        -- Motion Sensor Package
           Each motion sensor package contains a PIR motion detector and a resistive photocell
           light sensor. The package also reports it's battery level and regularly checks
           in with the sensor network (ZigBee Check-Ins).
            -- Control4-Motion and Control4-MotionArea
               Most motion sensors have a sticker in the lens that limits what it can see
               to approximately a 3-foot diameter circle when mounted on the ceiling facing
               down. Some motion sensors that do not have any sticker limiting their view
               are called Control4-MotionArea and can detect motion within view, though
               sensitivity to smaller body movements may be reduced beyond 20 feet.
                -- Message Values
                   Motion and MotionArea sensors always report ON or OFF.
                -- Frequency
                   The sensor will instantly send an ON message when detecting motion.
                   1.25 seconds after it no longer observes motion the sensor will send OFF.
            -- Control4-LightSensor
                -- Message Values
                   The light sensor will send integer values ranging from 0 to 100 (pitch
                   black to very bright). The Motion sensors with stickers in the lens have
                   a much more limited amount of light that hits the sensor, and may only
                   observe a range from 0 to 10, with a rare spike to a much higher value
                   when the lid is removed to replace a battery.
                -- Frequency
                   The current light level is bit-packed and sent with every message the
                   package sends on ZigBee, but the light sensor itself can initiate a ZigBee
                   message if the value changes by 15% from the last value it reported.
            -- Control4-BatteryPercent
                -- Message Values
                   The battery percent is always an integer ranging from 0 to 100.
                -- Frequency
                   The battery levels are only allowed to report once every 6 hours, but
                   only report when there is a change.  This means that some battery values
                   may not be updated for days as the level has not changed.
            -- Control4-Radio
               These sensor messages were enabled when we upgraded our data collection systems
               around 2014.
                -- Message Values
                   The ZigBee radio check-in always has the same message, OK.
                -- Frequency
                   The ZigBee radio checks in with the network about once every 30 minutes.
                   A sudden lack of radio check-ins may indicate this sensor's battery has
                   died or there is some interference disrupting communication on the ZigBee
                   network.
        -- Door Sensor Package
            -- Control4-Door
                -- Message Values
                   The door sensor always report OPEN or CLOSE.
                -- Frequency
                   The sensor sends the message as soon as the magnetic reed switch changes.
            -- Control4-Temperature
               All door sensor packages have an internal temporature sensor, and the ability
               to attach a second temperature probe.  This was used in some of the bathrooms
               for measuring the temperature at the door and right next to the shower.
                -- Message Values
                   Messages are a decimal in Celsius with 0.5 degrees Celsius accuracy.
                -- Frequency
                   Messages are sent when the sensor detects a change in the measured
                   temperature by 0.5 Celsius.
            -- Control4-BatteryPercent
                -- Message Values
                   The battery percent is always an integer ranging from 0 to 100.
                -- Frequency
                   The battery levels are only allowed to report once every 6 hours, but
                   only report when there is a change.  This means that some battery values
                   may not be updated for days as the level has not changed.
            -- Control4-Radio
                -- Message Values
                   The ZigBee radio check-in always has the same message, OK.
                -- Frequency
                   The ZigBee radio checks in with the network about once every 30 minutes.
                   A sudden lack of radio check-ins may indicate this sensor's battery has
                   died or there is some interference disrupting communication on the ZigBee
                   network.
        -- Light Switch Package
            -- Control4-Light
                -- Message Values
                   Light switch messages are integer values ranging from 0 to 100.  Some of
                   the lights are dimmers, they report the change in value from 0 to 100 as
                   they ramp up their brightness.  The switches simply report 0 or 100 when
                   they turn off or on.
                -- Frequency
                   The light switches only report light messages when the value changes.
            -- Control4-Button
               With the data collection upgrade in 2014 we were able to start collecting
               sensor events from residents interacting with the light switches.
                -- Message Values
                   The buttons have a variety of messages they send.  TAP is sent every time
                   the button is pressed.  When the button is doing being tapped, the button
                   will send TAP_COUNT_01 if the button was tapped once (we have observed
                   tap counts as high as 12, but do not know the limit of the device).
                   On the dimmer light switches there are also the DEPRESS and RELEASE messages
                   that are sent then the button is held down to slowly dim the light up
                   or down.
                -- Frequency
                   Messages are only sent with a participant interacts with the button.
            -- Control4-Radio
                -- Message Values
                   The ZigBee radio check-in always has the same message, OK.
                -- Frequency
                   The ZigBee radio checks in with the network about once every 15 minutes.
                   A sudden lack of radio check-ins may indicate this sensor's battery has

315,2024-10-28 16:20:50,Geographical Origin of Music,10/17/2014,Instances in this dataset contain audio features extracted from 1059 wave files. The task associated with the data is to predict the geographical origin of music.,Multivariate,Other,"Classification, Regression",Real,1059,68," The dataset was built from a personal collection of 1059 tracks covering 33 countries/area. The music used is traditional, ethnic or `world' only, as classified by the publishers of the product on which it appears. Any Western music is not included because its influence is global - what we seek are the aspects of music that most influence location. Thus, being able to specify a location with strong influence on the music is central. 

The geographical location of origin was manually collected the information from the CD sleeve notes, and when this information was inadequate we searched other information sources. The location data is limited in precision to the country of origin.  

The country of origin was determined by the artist's or artists' main country/area of residence.  Any track that had ambiguous origin is not included.  We have taken the position of each country's capital city (or the province of the area) by latitude and longitude as the absolute point of origin.

The program MARSYAS[1] was used to extract audio features from the wave files. We used the default MARSYAS settings in single vector format (68 features) to estimate the performance with basic timbal information covering the entire length of each track. No feature weighting or pre-filtering was applied. All features were transformed to have a mean of 0, and a standard deviation of 1. We also investigated the utility of adding chromatic attributes. These describe the notes of the scale being used. This is especially important as a distinguishing feature in geographical ethnomusicology. The chromatic features provided by MARSYAS are 12 per octave - Western tuning, but it may be possible to tell something from how similar to or different from Western tuning the music is.

I do not have that paper, but have found what is probably a later variation of that figure in Stepp's dissertation, which lists the value ""normal"" for the first 2 classes and ""irrelevant"" for the latter 2 classes.  I believe that ""irrelevant"" is used here as a synonym for ""not-applicable"", ""dna"", and ""does-not-apply"".  I believe that there is a mis-print in the figure he read in their PAMI-83 article.

Can you find them?",Multivariate,Computer Science,Classification,Real,20000,200000,"Attackers have the ability to intercept and add/remove medical evidence in medical imagery with high realism using deep learning. In this dataset we present medical deepfakes: 3D CT scans of human lungs, where some have been tampered with real cancer removed and with fake cancer injected. The objective of this dataset is to distinguish between real and fake cancers, and identify where medical scans have been tampered. Three expert radiologists have evaluated this dataset and could not reliably tell the difference between real and fake cancers, meaning that the fake cancers are realistic and this detection task is very challenging. For more information, please see our paper 'CT-GAN'.


The dataset consists of two sets (80 scans and 20 scans). The first 80 were used in a blind trial with the radiologists (they weren't told they were tampered), and the 20 scans were used in an open trial with the radiologists (they were told the truth and asked to identify them). 

Provided with the scans is a table with the ground truth. For each scan, where a cancer is located (x, y, and z [slice#]) and its classification. A location can be classified as being:
True-Benign, (TB): A location that actually has no cancer 
True-Malicious (TM): A location that has real cancer
False-Benign (FB): A location that has real cancer, but it was removed.
False-Malicious (FM): A location that does not have cancer, but fake cancer was injected there.

Access to the dataset is via this link: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1R0WD_5IZ3NlyCiOPf1Ex74nBnZYQegwr",No,"Each scan is in the medical dicom format, but it can be loaded as a 3D matrix with Python by using the tools provided in our code repository: https://github.com/ymirsky/CT-GAN

A scan is basically a series of 512x512 images. The series is usually about 100-300 slices long (the z axis). Cancers can occupy multiple slices along the z-axis.
The value at each pixel is the Hounsfield unit (radiodensity) at that location.

The goal is to learn to predict whether new molecules will be musks or non-musks.  However, the 166 features that describe these molecules depend upon the exact shape, or conformation, of the molecule.  Because bonds can rotate, a single molecule can adopt many different shapes.  To generate this data set, the low-energy conformations of the molecules were generated and then filtered to remove highly similar conformations. This left 476 conformations.  Then, a feature vector was extracted that describes each conformation.

This many-to-one relationship between feature vectors and molecules is called the ""multiple instance problem"".  When learning a classifier for this data, the classifier should classify a molecule as ""musk"" if ANY of its conformations is classified as a musk.

4. Relevant Information:
   -- Introduction
     The dataset consists of data collected from heavy Scania 
     trucks in everyday usage. The system in focus is the 
     Air Pressure system (APS) which generates pressurised 
     air that are utilized in various functions in a truck, 
     such as braking and gear changes. The datasets' 
     positive class consists of component failures 
     for a specific component of the APS system. 
     The negative class consists of trucks with failures 
     for components not related to the APS. The data consists 
     of a subset of all available data, selected by experts. 

   -- Challenge metric  

     Cost-metric of miss-classification:

     Predicted class |      True class       |
                     |    pos    |    neg    |
     -----------------------------------------
      pos            |     -     |  Cost_1   |
     -----------------------------------------
      neg            |  Cost_2   |     -     |
     -----------------------------------------
     Cost_1 = 10 and cost_2 = 500

     The total cost of a prediction model the sum of 'Cost_1' 
     multiplied by the number of Instances with type 1 failure 
     and 'Cost_2' with the number of instances with type 2 failure, 
     resulting in a 'Total_cost'.

     In this case Cost_1 refers to the cost that an unnessecary 
     check needs to be done by an mechanic at an workshop, while 
     Cost_2 refer to the cost of missing a faulty truck, 
     which may cause a breakdown.

     Total_cost = Cost_1*No_Instances + Cost_2*No_Instances.

5. Number of Instances: 
     The training set contains 60000 examples in total in which 
     59000 belong to the negative class and 1000 positive class. 
     The test set contains 16000 examples. 

6. Number of Attributes: 171 

7. Attribute Information:
   The attribute names of the data have been anonymized for 
   proprietary reasons. It consists of both single numerical 
   counters and histograms consisting of bins with different 
   conditions. Typically the histograms have open-ended 
   conditions at each end. For example if we measuring 
   the ambient temperature 'T' then the histogram could 
   be defined with 4 bins where: 

   bin 1 collect values for temperature T < -20
   bin 2 collect values for temperature T >= -20 and T < 0     
   bin 3 collect values for temperature T >= 0 and T < 20  
   bin 4 collect values for temperature T > 20 

   |  b1  |  b2  |  b3  |  b4  |   
   ----------------------------- 
         -20     0      20

  The attributes are as follows: class, then 
  anonymized operational data. The operational data have 
  an identifier and a bin id, like 'Identifier_Bin'.
  In total there are 171 attributes, of which 7 are 
  histogram variabels. Missing values are denoted by 'na'.",Yes ,"Attribute Information:

Useful for the prediction of molecular similarity evaluations by humans.,"Tabular, Image",Physics and Chemistry,Classification,-,200,-,"Molecular similarity is an impressively broad topic with many implications in several areas of chemistry. Its roots lie in the paradigm that âsimilar molecules have similar propertiesâ. For this reason, methods for determining molecular similarity find wide application in pharmaceutical companies, e.g., in the context of structure-activity relationships. The similarity evaluation is also used in the field of chemical legislation, specifically in the procedure to judge if a new molecule can obtain the status of orphan drug with the consequent financial benefits. For this procedure, the European Medicines Agency uses expertsâ judgments. It is clear that the perception of the similarity depends on the observer, so the development of models to reproduce the human perception is useful.

Models built on the dataset can be useful to reduce or assist human efforts in future evaluations.",The dataset was created by Enrico Gandini during his PhD at UniversitÃ  degli Studi di Milano.,"Molecular Similarity Perception Based on Machine-Learning Models

The reclassification in the original `bct' domain was simplified by extracting from files `qbxxx.spsum.txt' (where xxx = bct (bacteria), inv (invertebrates), mam (mammals), pln (plants), pri (primates), rod (rodents), vrt (vertebrates)) the different genus names of the entries, and making the classification by genus. There were 514 different genus names.  The different genus categories were checked and relabeled as `arc' where appropriate. In the eubacterial entries, the distinction was made of the bacterial genomes proper (keeping with the original label `bct'), and bacterial plasmids (now labeled `plm').  

Following these preprocessing steps, the final dataset file comprises all entries of the CUTG databases qbxxx.spsum.txt in one text file. As detailed above, the qbbct.spsum.txt entries were separated as `bct' (that is, eubacteria), `plm' (plasmids), and `arc' (archaea), a distinction not originally made in the CUTG database.",Yes ,"Column 1: Kingdom
Column 2: DNAtype
Column 3: SpeciesID
Column 4: Ncodons
Column 5: SpeciesName
Columns 6-69: codon (header: nucleotide bases; entries: frequency of usage (5 digit floating point number))

The 'Kingdom' is a 3-letter code corresponding to `xxx' in the CUTG database name: 'arc'(archaea), 'bct'(bacteria), 'phg'(bacteriophage), 'plm' (plasmid), 'pln' (plant), 'inv' (invertebrate), 'vrt' (vertebrate), 'mam' (mammal), 'rod' (rodent), 'pri' (primate), and 'vrl'(virus) sequence entries.  Note that the CUTG database does not contain 'arc' and 'plm' (these have been manually curated ourselves). 

The 'DNAtype' is denoted as an integer for the genomic composition in the species: 0-genomic, 1-mitochondrial, 2-chloroplast, 3-cyanelle, 4-plastid, 5-nucleomorph, 6-secondary_endosymbiont, 7-chromoplast, 8-leucoplast, 9-NA, 10-proplastid, 11-apicoplast, and 12-kinetoplast.

The species identifier ('SpeciesID') is an integer, which uniquely indicates the entries of an organism. It is an accession identifier for each different species in the original CUTG database, followed by the first item listed in each genome. 

The number of codons (`Ncodons') is the algebraic sum of the numbers listed for the different codons in an entry of CUTG. Codon frequencies are normalized to the total codon count, hence the number of occurrences divided by 'Ncodons' is the codon frequencies listed in the data file. 

The species' name ('SpeciesName') is represented in strings purged of `comma' (which are now replaced by `space'). This is a descriptive label of the name of the species for data interpretations. 

Lastly, the codon frequencies ('codon') including 'UUU', 'UUA', 'UUG', 'CUU', etc., are recorded as floats (with decimals in 5 digits).

However, the 166 features that describe these molecules depend upon the exact shape, or conformation, of the molecule.  Because bonds can rotate, a single molecule can adopt many different shapes.

Splice junctions are points on a DNA sequence at which `superfluous' DNA is removed during the process of protein creation in higher organisms.  The problem posed in this dataset is to recognize, given a sequence of DNA, the boundaries between exons (the parts of the DNA sequence retained after splicing) and introns (the parts of the DNA sequence that are spliced out). This problem consists of two subtasks: recognizing exon/intron boundaries (referred to as EI sites), and recognizing intron/exon boundaries (IE sites). (In the biological community, IE borders are referred to a ``acceptors'' while EI borders are referred to as ``donors''.)

This dataset has been developed to help evaluate a ""hybrid"" learning algorithm (KBANN) that uses examples to inductively refine preexisting knowledge.  Using a ""ten-fold cross-validation"" methodology on 1000 examples randomly selected from the complete set of 3190, the following  error rates were produced by various ML algorithms (all experiments run at the Univ of Wisconsin, sometimes with local implementations of published algorithms).

23,2024-10-28 16:23:11,Chess (King-Rook vs. King),5/31/1994,Chess Endgame Database for White King and Rook against Black King (KRK).,Multivariate,Games,Classification,"Categorical, Integer",28056,6,"An Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) or relational learning framework is assumed (Muggleton, 1992). The learning system is provided with examples of chess positions described only by the coordinates of the pieces on the board. Background knowledge in the form of row and column differences is also supplied. The relations necessary to form a correct and concise classifier for the target concept must be discovered by the learning system (the examples already provide a complete extensional definition). The task is closely related to Quinlan's (1983) application of ID3 to classify White King and Rook against Black King and Knight (KRKN) positions as lost 2-ply or lost 3-ply. The framework is similar in that the example positions supply only low-grade data. An important difference is that additional background predicates of the kind supplied in the KRKN study via hand-crafted attributes are not provided for this KRK domain.

Chess endgames are complex domains which are enumerable. Endgame databases are tables of stored game-theoretic values for the enumerated elements (legal positions) of the domain. The game-theoretic values stored denote whether or not positions are won for either side, or include also the depth of win (number of moves) assuming minimax-optimal play. From the point of view of experiments on computer induction such databases provide not only a source of examples but also an oracle (Roycroft, 1986) for testing induced rules. However a chess endgame database differs from, say, a relational database containing details of parts and suppliers in the following important respect. The combinatorics of computing the required game-theoretic values for individual position entries independently would be prohibitive. Therefore all the database entries are generated in a single iterative process using the ``standard backup'' algorithm (Thompson, 1986).

A KRK database was described by Clarke (1977). The current database was described and used for machine learning experiments in Bain (1992; 1994). It should be noted that our database is not guaranteed correct, but the class distribution is the same as Clarke's database. In (Bain 1992; 1994) the task was classification of positions in the database as won for white in a fixed number of moves, assuming optimal play by both sides. The problem was structured into separate sub-problems by depth-of-win ordered draw, zero, one, ..., sixteen. When learning depth d all examples at depths > d are used as negatives. Quinlan (1994) applied Foil to learn a complete and correct solution for this task.

The typical complexity of induced classifiers in this domain suggest that the task is demanding when background knowledge is restricted.",No,"Variable Name Role Type Description Units Missing Values

128,2024-10-28 16:23:17,Japanese Vowels,,This dataset records 640 time series of 12 LPC cepstrum coefficients taken from nine male speakers.,"Multivariate, Time-Series",Other,Classification,Real,640,-,"The data was collected for examining our newly developed classifier for multidimensional curves (multidimensional time series). Nine male speakers uttered two Japanese vowels /ae/ successively. For each utterance, with the analysis parameters described below, we applied 12-degree linear prediction analysis to it to obtain a discrete-time series with 12 LPC cepstrum coefficients. This means that one utterance by a speaker forms a time series whose length is in the range 7-29 and each point of a time series is of 12 features (12 coefficients).

The number of the time series is 640 in total. We used one set of 270 time series for training and the other set of 370 time series for testing.

Number of Instances (Utterances):

    * Training: 270 (30 utterances by 9 speakers. See file 'size_ae.train'.)
    * Testing: 370 (24-88 utterances by the same 9 speakers in different opportunities. See file 'size_ae.test'.) 

Length of Time Series:

    * 7 - 29 depending on utterances 

Analysis parameters:

    * Sampling rate : 10kHz
    * Frame length : 25.6 ms
    * Shift length : 6.4ms
    * Degree of LPC coefficients : 12 

Files:

    * Training file: ae.train
    * Testing file: ae.test 

Format:

Each line in ae.train or ae.test represents 12 LPC coefficients in the increasing order separated by spaces. This corresponds to one analysis frame.

Lines are organized into blocks, which are a set of 7-29 lines separated by blank lines and corresponds to a single speech utterance of /ae/ with 7-29 frames.

Each speaker is a set of consecutive blocks. In ae.train there are 30 blocks for each speaker. Blocks 1-30 represent speaker 1, blocks 31-60 represent speaker 2, and so on up to speaker 9. In ae.test, speakers 1 to 9 have the corresponding number of blocks: 31 35 88 44 29 24 40 50 29. Thus, blocks 1-31 represent speaker 1 (31 utterances of /ae/), blocks 32-66 represent speaker 2 (35 utterances of /ae/), and so on.",No,"Variable Name Role Type Description Units Missing Values

The first 8 features are kinematic properties measured by the particle detectors in the accelerator. The last ten features are functions of the first 8 features; these are high-level features derived by physicists to help discriminate between the two classes. There is an interest in using deep learning methods to obviate the need for physicists to manually develop such features. Benchmark results using Bayesian Decision Trees from a standard physics package and 5-layer neural networks and the dropout algorithm are presented in the original paper.

rate, between 0 and 1, of different car lanes of San Francisco bay area freeways. The measurements cover the period from Jan. 1st 2008 to Mar. 30th 2009 and are sampled every 10 minutes. We consider each day in this database as a single time series of dimension 963 (the number of sensors which functioned consistently throughout the studied period) and length 6 x 24=144. We remove public holidays from the dataset, as well
as two days with anomalies (March 8th 2009 and March 9th 2008) where all sensors were muted between 2:00 and 3:00 AM. This results in a database of 440 time series.

The task we propose on this dataset is to classify each observed day as the correct day of the week, from Monday to Sunday, e.g. label it with an integer in {1,2,3,4,5,6,7}. 

I will keep separate copies of this database on my website in a Matlab format. If you use Matlab, it might be more convenient to consider these .mat files directly.

Data-Format
-------------

There are two files for each fold, the data file and the labels file. We have split the 440 time series between train and test folds, but you are of course free to merge them to consider a different cross validation setting.
- The PEMS_train textfile has 263 lines. Each line describes a time-series provided as a matrix. The matrix syntax is that of Matlab, e.g. [ a b ; c d] is the matrix with row vectors [a b] and [c d] in that order. Each matrix describes the different occupancies rates (963 lines, one for each station/detector) sampled every 10 minutes during the day (144 columns).
- The PEMS_trainlabel text describes, for each day of measurements described above, the day of the week on which the data was sampled, namely an integer between 1 (Mon.) and 7 (Sun.).

- PEMS_test and PEMS_testlabels are formatted in the same way, except that there are 173 test instances.

- The permutation that I used to shuffle the dataset is given in the randperm file. If you need to rearrange the data so that it follows the calendar order, you should merge train and test samples and reorder them using the inverse permutation of randperm.",No,"Each attribute describes the measurement of the occupancy rate (between 0 and 1) of a captor location as recorded by a measuring station, at a given timestamp in time during the day.  The ID of each station is given in the stations_list text file. For more information on the location (GPS, Highway, Direction) of each station please refer to the PEMS website. There are 963 (stations) x 144 (timestamps) =  138.672 attributes for each record.

528,2024-10-28 16:37:14,Amphibians,7/16/2020,The dataset is a multilabel classification problem. The goal is to predict the presence of amphibians species near the water reservoirs based on features obtained from GIS systems and satellite images,Multivariate,Biology,Classification,"Integer, Real",189,23,"The data used was derived from GIS and satellite information, as well as from information gathered from the natural inventories that were prepared for the environmental impact assessment (EIA) reports for two planned road projects (Road A and Road B) in Poland. These reports were mostly used to gather information on the size of the amphibian population in each of the 189 occurrence sites.
Road A project concerned part of the planned A1 motorway section in Pyrzowice; the section is located along the northern border of the Silesian Voivodship and is about 75 km long. The field research involved a strip of land with a width of 500 m on both sides of the proposed project area. The field inventory was carried out in 2010 [1] and 2011 [2,3]. The results of these inventories were complemented by Marek SoÃâtysiak observations, which were conducted between 2014 and 2016 [4]. Finally, the first project included 80 amphibian breeding sites.
Road B inventory was prepared in the vicinity of two variants of the planned Beskidy Integration Way on the Bielsko BiaÃâa-Wadowice-GÃâogoczÃÂ³w section of the S52 motorway. The length of this section of road is approximately 60 km. During the inventory, which was taken in 2010, 125 real and potential amphibian occurrence sites were described in [5]. The methodology of the herpetological inventory included map analysis, literature and archive data analysis, and, then, field observations. As in the first case, the inventory was made in the spring time and consisted of the observation of the occurrence of amphibians in water reservoirs. The research area included a 500 m wide belt for each of the considered variants of the planned road. In order to conduct the final experiments, 109 amphibian occurrence sites were taken into account.

304,2024-10-28 16:37:18,BlogFeedback,5/28/2014,Instances in this dataset contain features extracted from blog posts. The task associated with the data is to predict how many comments the post will receive.,Multivariate,Social Science,Regression,"Integer, Real",60021,-,"This data originates from blog posts. The raw HTML-documents 
of the blog posts were crawled and processed. 
The prediction task associated with the data is the prediction 
of the number of comments in the upcoming 24 hours. In order 
to simulate this situation, we choose a basetime (in the past) 
and select the blog posts that were published at most
72 hours before the selected base date/time. Then, we calculate
all the features of the selected blog posts from the information 
that was available at the basetime, therefore each instance 
corresponds to a blog post. The target is the number of 
comments that the blog post received in the next 24 hours 
relative to the basetime. 

In the train data, the basetimes were in the years 
2010 and 2011. In the test data the basetimes were 
in February and March 2012. This simulates the real-world 
situtation in which training data from the past is available 
to predict events in the future.

The train data was generated from different basetimes that may 
temporally overlap. Therefore, if you simply split the train 
into disjoint partitions, the underlying time intervals may 
overlap. Therefore, the you should use the provided, temporally 
disjoint train and test splits in order to ensure that the
evaluation is fair. ",No,"Variable Name Role Type Description Units Missing Values

167,2024-10-28 16:37:22,Arcene,2/28/2008,ARCENE's task is to distinguish cancer versus normal patterns from mass-spectrometric data. This is a two-class classification problem with continuous input variables. This dataset is one of 5 datasets of the NIPS 2003 feature selection challenge.,Multivariate,Health and Medicine,Classification,Real,900,10000,"ARCENE was obtained by merging three mass-spectrometry datasets to obtain enough training and test data for a benchmark. The original features indicate the abundance of proteins in human sera having a given mass value. Based on those features one must separate cancer patients from healthy patients. We added a number of distractor feature called 'probes' having no predictive power. The order of the features and patterns were randomized.

Healthy subjects conducted six daily life grasps.,Time-Series,Health and Medicine,Classification,Real,3000,2500,"Instrumentation:
The data were collected at a sampling rate of 500 Hz, using as a programming kernel the National InstrumentÃ¢â¬â¢s (NI) Labview. The signals were band-pass filtered using a Butterworth Band Pass filter with low and high cutoff at 15Hz and 500Hz respectively and a notch filter at 50Hz to eliminate line interference artifacts.
The hardware that was used was an NI analog/digital conversion card NI USB- 009, mounted on a PC. The signal was taken from two Differential EMG Sensors and the signals were transmitted to a 2-channel EMG system by Delsys BagnoliÃ¢âÂ¢ Handheld EMG Systems.

Protocol: 
The experiments consisted of freely and repeatedly grasping of different items, which were essential to conduct the hand movements. The speed and force were intentionally left to the subjectÃ¢â¬â¢s will. There were two forearm surface EMG electrodes Flexor Capri Ulnaris and Extensor Capri Radialis, Longus and Brevis) held in place by elastic bands and the reference electrode in the middle, in order to gather information about the muscle activation.

The subjects were asked to perform repeatedly the following six movements, which can be considered as daily hand grasps:
a) Spherical: for holding spherical tools
b) Tip: for holding small tools 
c) Palmar: for grasping with palm facing the object
d) Lateral: for holding thin, flat objects
e) Cylindrical: for holding cylindrical tools
f) Hook: for supporting a heavy load

An illustrative photo is included in the data folder.

Two different databases are included:
1) 5 healthy subjects (two males and three females) of the same age approximately (20 to 22-year-old) conducted the six grasps for 30 times each. The measured time is 6 sec. There is a mat file available for every subject. 
2) 1 healthy subject (male, 22-year-old) conducted the six grasps for 100 times each for 3 consecutive days. The measured time is 5 sec. There is a mat file available for every day.",No,"Data Format:
The format of each mat file is the following: 
Ã¢â¬Â¢ The data per grasp and per channel are in separate table with an obvious naming. {Spherical --> (spher_ch1, spher_ch2), Tip --> (tip_ch1, tip_ch2), Palmar --> (palm_ch1, palm_ch2), Lateral --> (lat_ch1, lat_ch2), Cylindrical --> (cyl_ch1, cyl_ch2), Hook --> (hook_ch1, hook_ch2)}
Ã¢â¬Â¢ Each row of these tables has the whole signal per trial. The signal value is measured in Voltage.

In summary, in each subject, there will be a mat file with 12 matrixes, in which matrix there will be 30 (trials) rows and 3000 (points of the signal) columns for database 1 (or 100 rows and 2500 columns for database 2).

It is a multilabel dataset with three columns of labels. This dataset was created segmenting 60 audio records belonging to 4 different families, 8 genus, and 10 species. Each audio corresponds to one specimen (an individual frog), the record ID is also included as an extra column. We used the spectral entropy and a binary cluster method to detect audio frames belonging to each syllable. The segmentation and feature extraction were carried out in Matlab. After the segmentation we got 7195 syllables, which became instances for train and test the classifier. These records were collected in situ under real noise conditions (the background sound). Some species are from the campus of Federal University of Amazonas, Manaus, others from Mata AtlÃÂ¢ntica, Brazil, and one of them from CÃÂ³rdoba, Argentina. The recordings were stored in wav format with 44.1kHz of sampling frequency and 32bit of resolution, which allows us to analyze signals up to 22kHz. From every extracted syllable 22 MFCCs were calculated by using 44 triangular filters. These coefficients were normalized between -1 Ã¢â°Â¤ mfcc Ã¢â°Â¤ 1. The amount of instances per class are:

The array includes 8 MOX gas sensors, and humidity and temperature sensors.","Multivariate, Time-Series",Computer Science,Classification,Real,919438,-,"This dataset has recordings of a gas sensor array composed of 8 MOX gas sensors, and a temperature and humidity sensor. This sensor array was exposed to background home activity while subject to two different stimuli: wine and banana. The responses to banana and wine stimuli were recorded by placing the stimulus close to the sensors. The duration of each stimulation varied from 7min to 2h, with an average duration of 42min. This dataset contains a set of time series from three different conditions: wine, banana and background activity. There are 36 inductions with wine, 33 with banana and 31 recordings of background activity. One possible application is to discriminate among background, wine and banana.

This dataset is composed of two files: HT_sensor_dataset.dat (zipped), where the actual time series are stored, and the HT_Sensor_metadata.dat, where metadata for each induction is stored. Each induction is uniquely identified by an id in both files. Thus, metadata for a particular induction can be easily found by matching columns id from each file. 

We also made available python scripts to exemplify how to import, organize and plot our data. The scripts are available on GitHub:
https://github.com/thmosqueiro/ENose-Decorr_Humdt_Temp

For each induction, we include one hour of background activity prior to and after the stimulus presentation. Time series were recorded at one sample per second, with minor variations at some data points due to issues in the wireless communication. For details on which sensors were used and how the time series is organized, see Attribute Information below.

The metadata stored in file HT_Sensor_metadata.dat is divided in the following columns:

* id: identification of the induction, to be matched with id in file HT_Sensor_dataset.dat;
* date: day, month and year when this induction was recorded;
* class: what was used to generate this induction (wine, banana or background);
* t0: time in hours in which the induction started (represents the time zero in file HT_Sensor_dataset.dat);

Auction ID: Unique identifier of an auction.
Bidder ID: Unique identifier of a bidder.
Bidder Tendency: A shill bidder participates exclusively in auctions of few sellers rather than a diversified lot.  This is a collusive act involving the fraudulent seller and an accomplice.
Bidding Ratio: A shill bidder participates more frequently to raise the auction price and attract higher bids from legitimate participants.
Successive Outbidding: A shill bidder successively outbids himself even though he is the current winner to increase the price gradually with small consecutive increments.
Last Bidding: A shill bidder becomes inactive at the last stage of the auction (more than 90\% of the auction duration) to avoid winning the auction.
Auction Bids: Auctions with SB activities tend to have a much higher number of bids than the average of bids in concurrent auctions.
Auction Starting Price:  a shill bidder usually offers a small starting price to attract legitimate bidders into the auction.
Early Bidding: A shill bidder tends to bid pretty early in the auction (less than 25\% of the auction duration) to get the attention of auction users.

   (c) Indication of study's results.  Significant predictions in multiple portfolios.  See publications.
4. Relevant Information Paragraph:
   The files were zipped (on a Windows machine) by year.
   The data here are the ZZAlphaÃÂ® machine learning recommendations made for various US traded stock portfolios the morning of each day during the 3 year period Jan 1, 2012 - Dec 31, 2014.  They are deposited here in .txt form for easy accessibility (and as a convenience to users, have had results included for each recommendation).  
A .pdf version of the original recommendations file was certified by Digistamp (.p7s) at time of creation each day for stringent auditability.  Please contact info@zzalpha.com if you desire to purchase the set of the certified .pdf, .p7s file pairs.  The certified set contains only the recommendations, not the results included in the deposited set here.
For convenience, the data deposited includes calculated returns (outcomes) for each recommended transaction.  The returns obviously were not part of the original recommendations when made, but were appended later.  Returns were calculated several days after sale day.
The date inside the file reflects the date for which morning trading recommendation was made.  The evaluation of the recommendations, as described in the KDD 2015 article mentioned above, involved comparison of the opening price of the day of recommendation to the opening price five market days later.  As mentioned in the article, evaluation must be adjusted by trading costs and constraints.
A recommendation portfolio consists of a segment, a size (1,2,5,10,20), and a side (Long or Short),  and the ticker symbols of the companies recommended for price increase (or decrease in the case of Short) from the opening price to the opening price 5 trading days later.
The stocks included must first pass a general screen of $3 recent price and 80,000 recent daily average share volume for inclusion.  Thus penny stocks and micro-caps are not present and even some large cap, but very low prices stocks are omitted.  All stocks must be traded on NYSE, NASDAQ or AMEX at the time of recommendation.
The daily file contains all recommendations for all portfolios for the day.  Both long and short recommendations are included. Long entries have duplicates.

These are the portfolios:  (Note other portfolios limited to ETFs (exchange traded funds) may be listed each day.  Due to data issues those are incomplete across the time period.)
 

5. Number of Instances: 755 market days, 41 portfolios, 5 sizes of portfolios, Long and Short
6. Number of Attributes 
   The data set submitted does not include attributes used for prediction. This data is provided as a benchmark of machine learning results in a longitudinal 3 yr period. 

Here is a sample content of a line in the files:

The above indicates recommendations were made before market open on Jan 4, 2005.  This portfolio was limited to the biggest 100 cap stocks and was of size 5.  It was for 'L' or long recommendations.  The five stocks recommended are shown by ticker, result, price at sale divided by price at purchase.  The average for the five is shown.


Note: The user of this data set must implement its own parser of these files.  The contributor does NOT provide one.
Note: The prices used are adjusted prices based on data when results were calculated.  Back-calculation of the adjusted prices using newer data may give different prices, but the ratios will remain the same (+/- rounding errors).

326,2024-10-28 16:38:40,TV News Channel Commercial Detection Dataset,3/26/2015,TV Commercials data set consists of standard audio-visual features of video shots extracted from 150 hours of TV news broadcast of 3 Indian and 2 international news channels ( 30 Hours each).,Multivariate,Computer Science,"Classification, Clustering",Real,129685,12,"Automatic identification of commercial blocks in news videos finds a lot of applications in the domain of television broadcast analysis and monitoring. Commercials occupy almost 40-60%  of total air time. Manual segmentation of commercials from thousands of TV news channels is time consuming, and economically infeasible hence prompts the need for machine learning based Method. Classifying TV News commercials is a semantic video classification problem. TV News commercials on particular news channel are combinations of video shots uniquely characterized by audio-visual presentation. Hence various audio visual features extracted from video shots are widely used for TV commercial classification.  Indian News channels do not follow any particular news presentation format, have large variability and  dynamic nature presenting a challenging machine learning problem.  Features from 150 Hours of broadcast news videos from 5 different ( 3 Indian and  2 International News channels)  news channels. Viz. CNNIBN, NDTV 24X7, TIMESNOW, BBC and CNN are presented in this dataset.  Videos are recorded at resolution of 720 X 576 at 25 fps  using a DVR and set top box. 3 Indian channels are recorded concurrently while 2 International are recorded together. Feature file preserves the order of occurrence of shots.  ",No,"Video shots are used as unit for generating instances. Broadcast News videos are segmented into video shots using RGB Colour Histogram matching Between consecutive video frames. From each video shot we have extracted 7 Audio ( viz. Short term energy,  zero crossing rate, Spectral Centroid, spectral Flux, spectral Roll off frequency, fundamental frequency and MFCC Bag of Audio Words) and 5 visual Features ( viz. Video shot length, Screen Text Distribution,  Motion Distribution, Frame Difference Distribution, Edge Change Ratio) from each video shot. Details of each extracted feature are as follows.
Audio Features :- 
In general to attract viewer's attention TV commercials have higher audio amplitude, appropriate background music ( comparatively higher frequencies) as well as sharp transitions from one music to other or music to speech etc. We try to capture these properties by using low level audio features -- Short Time Energy (STE) ,  Zero Crossing Rate (ZCR), Spectral Centroid, Spectral Flux,  Spectral Roll-Off Frequency and Fundamental Frequency.  All of these short term audio features are calculated with audio frame size of 20 msec at 8000Hz sampling Frequency.  The Mean and standard deviation of all audio feature values are calculated over the shot, generating a 2D vector for each feature. 
The MFCC Bag of Audio Words have been successfully used in several existing speech/audio processing applications. This motivated us to compute the MFCC coefficients along with Delta and Delta-Delta Cepstrum from 150 hours of audio tracks. These coefficients are clustered into 4000 groups which form the Audio words. Each shot is then represented as a  4000 Dimensional Bag of Audio Words by forming the normalized histograms of the MFCC's extracted from 20 ms windows with overlap of 10 ms in the shots. 

Video Features : 
Commercial video shots are usually short in length, fast visual transitions with peculiar placement of overlaid text bands. Video Shot Length is directly used as one of the feature. Placement of overlaid text bands is represented by  15 dimensional overlaid Text Distribution. To calculate Text Distribution feature, video frame is divided into a grid of size 5 X 3( 15 grid blocks).  The text distribution feature is obtained by averaging the fraction of text area present in a grid block over all frames of the shot. Motion Distribution, Frame Change Distribution and Edge Change Ratio captures the dynamic nature of the commercial shots. 
Motion Distribution is obtained by first computing dense optical flow (Horn-Schunk formulation) followed by  construction of a distribution of flow magnitudes over the entire shot with 40 uniformly divided bins in range of [0, 40]. Sudden changes in pixel intensities are grasped by Frame Difference Distribution. Such changes are not registered by optical flow. Thus, Frame Difference Distribution is also computed along with flow magnitude distributions. We obtain the frame difference by averaging absolute frame difference in each of 3 color channels and the distribution is constructed with 32 bins in the range of [0, 255] . Edge Change Ratio Captures the motion of edges between consecutive frames and is defined as ratio of displaced edge pixels to the total number of edge pixels in a frame. We calculate the mean and variance of the ECR over the entire shot. 


The Feature File is represented in Lib SVM data format and contains approximetly 63% commercial instances( Positives). Dimension index for different Features are as Follows

1. Each row can not be used independently, because is one of the three replications of one individual. Nature of data is dependent    for each subject, but independent from one to another subject. So, traditional technique from machine learning can not be applied to this dataset, because those techniques are based on the independent nature of the instances. There are 240 instances but for only 80 subjects, so they are not independent. Techniques as those presented in Naranjo et al. (2016), Naranjo et al. (2017) or other specifically designed can be used. 

2. The concept of replication considered here does not match the classical concept of statistical repeated measurements. The term 'replications' refers to the collection of features extracted from voice recordings belonging to the same subject. Since, in this context, features are extracted from multiple consecutive voice recordings from the same subject, in principle, the features should be identical. The imperfections in technology and the own biological variability result in non-identical replicated features that are more similar to one another than features from different subjects.

194,2024-10-28 16:39:06,Wall-Following Robot Navigation Data,8/3/2010,"The data were collected as the SCITOS G5 robot navigates through the room following the wall in a clockwise direction, for 4 rounds, using 24 ultrasound sensors arranged circularly around its 'waist'.","Multivariate, Sequential",Computer Science,Classification,Real,5456,-,"The provided files comprise three different data sets. The first one contains the raw values of the measurements 
of all 24 ultrasound sensors and the corresponding class label (see Section 7). Sensor readings are sampled at a 
rate of 9 samples per second.

The second one contains four sensor readings named 'simplified distances' and the corresponding class label (see Section 7). These simplified distances are referred to as the 'front distance', 'left distance', 'right distance' and 'back distance'. They consist, respectively, of the minimum sensor readings among those within 60 degree arcs located at the front, left, right and back parts of the robot.

The third one contains only the front and left simplified distances and the corresponding class label.

It is worth mentioning that the 24 ultrasound readings and the simplified distances were collected at the same time step, so each file has the same number of rows (one for each sampling time step).

The wall-following task and data gathering were designed to test the hypothesis that this apparently simple navigation task is indeed a non-linearly separable classification task. Thus, linear classifiers, such as the Perceptron network, are not able to learn the task and command the robot around the room without collisions. Nonlinear neural classifiers, such as the MLP network, are able to learn the task and command the robot successfully without collisions. 

If some kind of short-term memory mechanism is provided to the neural classifiers, their performances are improved in general. For example, if past inputs are provided together with current sensor readings, even the Perceptron becomes able to learn the task and command the robot succesfully. If a recurrent neural network, such as the Elman network, is used to learn the task, the resulting dynamical classifier is able to learn the task using less hidden neurons than the MLP network.

Files with different number of sensor readings were built in order to evaluate the performance of the classifiers with respect to the number of inputs.",No,"Variable Name Role Type Description Units Missing Values

ABSTRACT: Machine learning tools show significant promise for knowledge acquisition, particularly when human expertise is inadequate. Recently, process delays known as cylinder banding in rotogravure printing were substantially mitigated using control rules discovered by decision tree induction. Our work exemplifies a more general methodology which transforms the knowledge acquisition task from one in which rules are directly elicited from an expert, to one in which a learning system is responsible for rule generation. The primary responsibilities of the human expert are to evaluate the merits of generated rules, and to guide the acquisition and classification of data necessary for machine induction. These responsibilities require the expert to do what an expert does best: to exercise his or her expertise. This seems a more natural fit to an expert's capabilities than the requirements of traditional methodologies that experts explicitly enumerate the rules that they employ.",Yes ,"Variable Name Role Type Description Units Missing Values
