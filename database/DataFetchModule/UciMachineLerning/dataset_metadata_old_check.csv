For more details, consult: http://www.vinhoverde.pt/en/ or the reference [Cortez et al., 2009].  Due to privacy and logistic issues, only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables are available (e.g. there is no data about grape types, wine brand, wine selling price, etc.).

These datasets can be viewed as classification or regression tasks.  The classes are ordered and not balanced (e.g. there are many more normal wines than excellent or poor ones). Outlier detection algorithms could be used to detect the few excellent or poor wines. Also, we are not sure if all input variables are relevant.

They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image. A few of the images can be found at http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~street/images/

Separating plane described above was obtained using Multisurface Method-Tree (MSM-T) [K. P. Bennett, ""Decision Tree Construction Via Linear Programming."" Proceedings of the 4th Midwest Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Science Society, pp. 97-101, 1992], a classification method which uses linear programming to construct a decision tree.  Relevant features were selected using an exhaustive search in the space of 1-4 features and 1-3 separating planes.

The actual linear program used to obtain the separating plane in the 3-dimensional space is that described in: [K. P. Bennett and O. L. Mangasarian: ""Robust Linear Programming Discrimination of Two Linearly Inseparable Sets"", Optimization Methods and Software 1, 1992, 23-34].

For paper records, fixed times were assigned to breakfast (08:00), lunch (12:00), dinner (18:00), and bedtime (22:00).  Thus paper records have fictitious uniform recording times whereas electronic records have more realistic time stamps.

Diabetes files consist of four fields per record.  Each field is separated by a tab and each record is separated by a newline.

File Names and format:
(1) Date in MM-DD-YYYY format
(2) Time in XX:YY format
(3) Code
(4) Value

The Code field is deciphered as follows:

34 = NPH insulin dose
35 = UltraLente insulin dose
48 = Unspecified blood glucose measurement
57 = Unspecified blood glucose measurement
58 = Pre-breakfast blood glucose measurement

The second rating corresponds to the degree to which the auto is more risky than its price indicates. Cars are initially assigned a risk factor symbol associated with its price.   Then, if it is more risky (or less), this symbol is adjusted by moving it up (or down) the scale.  Actuarians call this process ""symboling"".  A value of +3 indicates that the auto is risky, -3 that it is probably pretty safe.

The third factor is the relative average loss payment per insured vehicle year.  This value is normalized for all autos within a particular size classification (two-door small, station wagons, sports/speciality, etc...), and represents the average loss per car per year.

Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

Check the README.txt file for further details about this dataset.

From the perspective of risk management, the result of predictive accuracy of the estimated probability of default will be more valuable than the binary result of classification - credible or not credible clients. Because the real probability of default is unknown, this study presented the novel Sorting Smoothing Method to estimate the real probability of default. With the real probability of default as the response variable (Y), and the predictive probability of default as the independent variable (X), the simple linear regression result (Y = A + BX) shows that the forecasting model produced by artificial neural network has the highest coefficient of determination; its regression intercept (A) is close to zero, and regression coefficient (B) to one. Therefore, among the six data mining techniques, artificial neural network is the only one that can accurately estimate the real probability of default.",No,"The comparisons of data mining techniques for the predictive accuracy of probability of default of credit card clients

Today, there exists great interest in these systems due to their important role in traffic, environmental and health issues. 

Apart from interesting real world applications of bike sharing systems, the characteristics of data being generated by these systems make them attractive for the research. Opposed to other transport services such as bus or subway, the duration of travel, departure and arrival position is explicitly recorded in these systems. This feature turns bike sharing system into a virtual sensor network that can be used for sensing mobility in the city.

The classification task for this dataset is to determine whether a given email is spam or not.
 
Our collection of spam e-mails came from our postmaster and individuals who had filed spam.  Our collection of non-spam e-mails came from filed work and personal e-mails, and hence the word 'george' and the area code '650' are indicators of non-spam.  These are useful when constructing a personalized spam filter.  One would either have to blind such non-spam indicators or get a very wide collection of non-spam to generate a general purpose spam filter.

For background on spam: Cranor, Lorrie F., LaMacchia, Brian A.  Spam!, Communications of the ACM, 41(8):74-83, 1998.

Typical performance is around ~7% misclassification error. False positives (marking good mail as spam) are very undesirable.If we insist on zero false positives in the training/testing set, 20-25% of the spam passed through the filter.
